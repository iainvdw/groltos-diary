- [ ] [[King Baerick Battlehammar]] apparently went mad after wearing armor and trinkets made of chardalyn.
	- Madness not directly tied to chardalyn, as the king was turned into a derro. This was caused by mindflayer magic. Metal could still have something to do with it though. Need to investigate.

	- On the way to [[Battlehammar Hold]] we got buried by an avalanche, caused by an earthquake. Later we discovered still growing spikes of this same metal having burst from the ground. Apparently the metal is called chardalyn.
	- The dwarves in [[Battlehammar Hold]] mine and forge this metal instead of iron, for having way better properties.
	- What is causing chardalyn to grow continuously? Is this metal safe to use? Guess we have to find out.
	- We learned from [[Vellynne Harpell]] that chardalyn is called Crenshinibon in ancient elvish. The metal seems to thrive and grow in very cold climates.
