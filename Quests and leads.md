	- Name is [[Omareth Baenre]], belonging to the most powerful family in Menzoberranzan.

### Colder than steel
- [ ] [[Kelvin's Cairn]] seems to be a source for a newly discovered metal with great properties for forging and retaining magic enchantments.
	- [[Rotom Moonbane|Rotom]] has a couple of metal shards with her, originally found by [[Marlon Tayte|Marlon]] when we defeated the [[Ghost|ghost]] in the [[4. Gloom and Gems|mine]]. The shards have grown in size since we found them.
	- On the way to [[Battlehammar Hold]] we got buried by an avalanche, caused by an earthquake. Later we discovered still growing spikes of this same metal having burst from the ground. Apparently the metal is called chardalyn.
	- The dwarves in [[Battlehammar Hold]] mine and forge this metal instead of iron, for having way better properties.
	- What is causing chardalyn to grow continuously? Is this metal safe to use? Guess we have to find out.
	- We learned from [[Vellynne Harpell]] that chardalyn is called Crenshinibon in ancient elvish. The metal seems to thrive and grow as a root-like system in very cold climates.
	- Crenshinibon apparently originates from a distant planet, having crashed here for some reason.
	- Duergar were mining chardalyn to manufacture a mechanical dragon.

	- We managed to retrieve the stolen goods from the [[Duergar Fortress]]

### The Mad King
- [x] [[King Baerick Battlehammar]] apparently went mad after wearing armor and trinkets made of chardalyn.
	- Madness not directly tied to chardalyn, as the king was turned into a derro. This was caused by mindflayer magic. Metal could still have something to do with it though. Need to investigate.
	- We need someone with powerful healing abilities to lift this magic or curse from the king.
