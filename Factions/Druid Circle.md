# Druid Circle
![[druid-circle.png]]
In the woods near [[Termalaine]] and [[Lonelywood]] there is a hidden druid circle that can apparently only be found by elves. It features a circular indentation, surrounded by a ten foot high embankment.

In the middle of the circle, there stood a carved crystal gnomon, its shadow pointing to one of five phases of the moon which were carved in the floor on the eastern side of it.

On top of the embankment, there seemed to be a tomb, also surrounded by five pillars on the eastern side.

At the entrance to this place, there were six elven statues. One statue for each elven subrace. One of the statues was of the drow necromancer that killed [[Yerthid Granitemuncher|Yerthid]].
