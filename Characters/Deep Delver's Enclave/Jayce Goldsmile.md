# Jayce Goldsmile
Deep gnome woman from [[Deep Delver's Enclave]], runs an artifact shop there in mechanical items and specialised glass equipment. Lost her spectacles in the recent thefts.

We retrieved her spectacles in the [[Duergar Fortress]] when we were looking for the stolen items.

Bought two new crossbows from Jayce, after getting a massive discount with [[Santiago Cruz de los Santos|Santiago]]'s help, as he promised Jayce that I would go on a date with her.

During [[17. The Siege of Deep Delver's Enclave]], Jayce gave me three grenades to help fend off the undead horde.
