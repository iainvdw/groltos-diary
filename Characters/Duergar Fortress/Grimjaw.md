# Grimjaw

A massive firbolg, seemingly in service of the [[Duergar|duerger]] in the [[Duergar Fortress]]. We had to kill it as it was attacking us, as [[Nildar Sunblight]] commanded it to. Found a silver broach when I searched through their belongings, depicting a pool bathing in moonlight, a symbol of the drow goddess, Eilistraee.
