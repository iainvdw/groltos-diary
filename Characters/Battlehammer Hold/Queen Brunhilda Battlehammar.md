![[queen-brunhilde-battlehammer.jpg]]

The dwarven queen of [[Battlehammer Hold]]. Wife to the maddened dwarven king. Soon after the king went mad, Queen Brunhilde prohibited the mining and forging of chardalyn, only to be faced with mutinous behaviour of her dwarven subjects, who left Battlehammer Hold and formed an enclave deeper into [[Kelvin's Cairn]] called [[Deep Delver's Enclave]].
