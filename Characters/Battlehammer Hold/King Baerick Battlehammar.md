# King Baerick Battlehammar

The dwarven king gone mad of [[Battlehammar Hold]]. Married to [[Queen Brunhilda Battlehammar]]. Old friend of [[Bailon the Beardless]]. 

Was apparently enthused by the newly discovered metal chardalyn, for its fantastical forging and magical properties. Soon after the discovery of the metal, the king went mad. Queen Brunhilde thought this madness was caused by the metal.

We met a [[Vellynne Harpell]] in [[Deep Delver's Enclave]] who was willing to help lift the king's curse if we helped her out. After we showed our goodwill, she traveled up towards Battlehammer Hold and saved the king from his torment.

The king rode back to Deep Delver's Enclave together with Vellynne during the [[17. The Siege of Deep Delver's Enclave]] and fought the undead from the opposite side of the cavern. We met the king when the siege was over and promised us a reward when we got back up.
