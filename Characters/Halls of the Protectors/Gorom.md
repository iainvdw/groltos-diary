# Gorom
![[gorom.png]]
Ancient mysterious being of [[Kelvin's Cairn]]. Apparently as old as the mountain itself. Is regarded as a kind of an oracle. Should be located in [[The Halls of the Protectors]].

Found Gorom as it was being interrogated by a [[Mind flayer|mind flayer]], psychically tormenting it. After we killed the mind flayer, Gorom wanted to help us. Gave us advice and teachings during a dreamy trance.

Gorom is a stone giant trapped in the chardalyn of the mountain. This caused him to gain great powers, seeing visions and having prophetic dreams.
