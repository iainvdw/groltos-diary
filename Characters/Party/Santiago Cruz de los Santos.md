# Santiago Cruz de los Santos
Orc pirate, male. Big mouthed. Doesn't shy away from walking straight into trouble all the time. Wanted me to come along, to join his search for his lost ship.

Keeps [[Rotom Moonbane]] happy by providing her with all kinds of shiny things.

Turned out to be afraid of water when we were [[2. A Cold Welcome|on the boat in Maer Dualdon]]. Rather strange, for a pirate...
