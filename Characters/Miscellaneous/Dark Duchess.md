# Dark Duchess

Someone or something [[Santiago Cruz de los Santos|Santiago]] mentioned in his sleep in [[4. Gloom and Gems]]. Doesn't bode well.

We learned from [[Vellynne Harpell]] that The Dark Duchess is actually the name of a ship. The very ship that [[Santiago Cruz de los Santos|Santiago]]'s looking for, containing vast riches. Vellynne asked us to go there and retrieve some research document, as [[Shadowreach]] is now overrun with undead.
