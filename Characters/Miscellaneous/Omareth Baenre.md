# Omareth Baenre
![[omareth-baenre.jpg]]

The drow necromancer that killed [[Yerthid Granitemuncher|Yerthid]]. Has a statue at the [[Sunless Grove]] with an inscription:

> Champion of Malar, god of the hunt. Sovereign of the Growing Mountain.

The Baenre family is one the most powerful families in Menzoberranzan. How do they tie into all of this?!

Having seen Omareth's appearance more recently, it seems he has been able to transcend the boundaries of life through undeath, having been able to become a lich.

I learned from [[Gorom]] that Omareth resides in the [[The Black Cathedral]], which is a monument to Crenshinibon.
