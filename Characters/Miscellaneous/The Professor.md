# The Professor

A magical talking orb, previously belonging to [[Nass Lantomir]] and [[Vellynne Harpell]]. It contains knowledge on a number of topics:

1. The history of Netheril and how to create a mythallar
2. Vampirism and the traits of vampires 
3. Rituals surrounding the making, bottling, and drinking of Elverquisst 
4. The tarrasque

It is now back in the possession of [[Vellynne Harpell]] as it was purportedly "borrowed" by [[Nass Lantomir]].

Lots of people coming into [[Bryn Shander]] from other towns, who are having trouble with managing the religious zeal of followers of the [[Creed of Auril]], mainly [[Caer-Dineval]] and [[Targos]]. Got in town early to have one on one sessions with speakers they can trust.

Oarus mentions the Creed consists mainly of cells, but there is some hierarchy.
