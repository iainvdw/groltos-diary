# Yerthid Granitemuncher

The love of my life. Met her back in [[Blingdenstone]]. Married her a long time ago. She was killed in a dark ritual by [[Omareth Baenre]]. Carry a fragment of her soul in my silver locket, which was left to me by that same wizard for some cruel joke.

When I met [[Gorom]], I learned that Yerthid is not truly dead yet as her soul is carried in my silver locket. There are means to save her and bring her back to life, but that would require very powerful magic.
