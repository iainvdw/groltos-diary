# Auril, the Frostmaiden
The Goddess of Winter. An evil deity that was the embodiment of harsh cold wrath of winter. Revered around [[Ten Towns]] as the bringer of the Endless Winter, people have started to turn to sacrifices to appease their goddess, hoping to calm down the raging blizzards and freezing nights.

In [[Kelvin's Cairn]], [[Santiago Cruz de los Santos|Santiago]] learned from [[Gorom]] that she wishes to be left alone. She lairs in the carcass of an ancient titan, somewhere in the [[Reghed Glacier]].
