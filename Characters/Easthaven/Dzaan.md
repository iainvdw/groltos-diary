# Dzaan

A wizard from [[Easthaven]] that visited [[Speaker Oarus|Oarus]] to inquire about the elemental lantern. He needed it to find a certain titan. Could be referencing Dur-Baagal the Dawn Titan that was defeated by [[Auril, The Frostmaiden|Auril]] and the six elven champions we learned about at the [[Sunless Grove]]?

Later, we learned that [[Auril, The Frostmaiden|Auril]] resides in the remains of a titan. Could it be that Dzaan was looking for Auril?
