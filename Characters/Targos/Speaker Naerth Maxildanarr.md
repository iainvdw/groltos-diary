# Speaker Naerth Maxildanarr

Naerth Maxildanarr, [[Targos]]' Speaker. Initially we tried to find him at the Luskan Arms inn, but never got to do that went things went sour. Fairly new speaker in [[Ten Towns]], elected just over a year ago.

Is apparently mixed up in some shady dealings regarding the sacrifices around Ten Towns. Apparently you can buy your way out the lottery for a hefty sum of gold, only to still end up days later with a note that reads "Auril always get's her due".
