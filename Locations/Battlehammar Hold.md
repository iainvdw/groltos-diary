# Battlehammar Hold
The dwarven settlement in [[Kelvin's Cairn]]. Ruled by [[Queen Brunhilda Battlehammar]] and [[King Baerick Battlehammar]]. King Baerick went mad for some reason. We discover that it was probably mindflayer magic having turned him into a derro.

Dwarves left the hold to live and work deeper in the mountain and founded an enclave called [[Deep Delver's Enclave]]. Dwarves there mine for chardalyn, a newly discovered metal.
