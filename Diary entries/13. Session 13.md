# Session 13
We search for shelter outside the duergar outpost. Aedan finds a building with a view on the monolith, although it's a bit damp and mildewy.

Aust, Aedan and I take watch during the night.

A white moth appears on the mushrooms, flies away, multiplying time after time again, until a swirling maelstrom appears, turning into a bloodied white cloak with red stars, an elf with obsidian skin and white hair appearing from it. It's Omareth!

The spiders come closer and spit webbing on the duergar and Santiago and they are stuck to the ground. Aedan whips one spider and pulling it closer, just in range of my crossbow, which I use to fire at it.

The spiders attack Aust and Santiago, missing Aust, but hitting
