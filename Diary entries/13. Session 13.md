# Session 13
We search for shelter outside the duergar outpost. Aedan finds a building with a view on the monolith, although it's a bit damp and mildewy.

Aust, Aedan and I take watch during the night.

A white moth appears on the mushrooms, flies away, multiplying time after time again, until a swirling maelstrom appears, turning into a bloodied white cloak with red stars, an elf with obsidian skin and white hair appearing from it. It's Omareth!

Hovers above us, asks for my blood. Rime wakes from his meditation, sees Omareth and tries to cast a spell to bind him. It fails. Santiago wakes up and also tries a spell, which fails as well. Omareth retributes with seven magic missiles. I try to calm everybody down, offer my hand and Omareth takes a small needle with which he takes a drop of my blood.

He looks me in the eye and says:
"Delban is coming, and I am his herald"

We get out of the building and go towards the cave entrance. Rotom scouts ahead and whispers down the hallway that all is clear.

We walk into the duergar outpost. Go through the gate and follow a hallway into a room embedded in green light from a fire pit burning with alchemist's fire. I suggest to Santiago to use his magic to spot these invisible buggers. As he does so, he immediately spots one hiding behind crates further into the mine, and start charging at it.

Instead of attacking the duergar immediately, like we were used from him, he starts talking to it and suggests the duergar is his child and needs to protect its father with its life. The small duergar does so and immediately throws a javelin to a spider on the ceiling behind him.

The spiders come closer and spit webbing on the duergar and Santiago and they are stuck to the ground. Aedan whips one spider and pulling it closer, just in range of my crossbow, which I use to fire at it.

The spiders attack Aust and Santiago, missing Aust, but hitting Santiago with their poisoned fangs.

See two duergar running past, we chase past them. I run to the south, inspecting another hallway. See another wall of crates, hear voices behind them, shouting "please, help us! take us!". Walking over the crates, two dwarves in a cell.

Aust and Aedan see another hallway ending at a stone door, seemingly trapped with bars and arrow slits. Rotom can't find any trigger, so we assume the trap is manually triggered by someone behind the slits or door.

At this point, we hear a deep loud voice shouting "Release the Grimjaw!" from the northern part of the cavern. Rotom and I run towards it, as we can't find Santiago and think he's in trouble. We hear the stone door burst open behind us, something storming at Aust and Aedan.

We spot Santiago talking to an enormous dwarf called Nildar, who appears to be something of a leader, who was seemingly awakened by Santiago exploring this part of the cavern alone. Nildar's issuing commands to four lesser duergar, standing in the hallway. The duergar start throwing javelins at Santiago, and at Rotom, who's made it nearly towards the duergar at this point. Rotom runs across the hallway, slides underneath between Nildar's legs and start distracting our opponents by groveling and cowering.

Santiago seems to have some sort of control over Nildar, as Santiago keeps suggesting actions to take and commands to issue, to which the leader obliges. Nildar sends two of the duergar off to fight the others at the other entrance, while the other two remain, assessing Nildar's erratic behaviour. I use this opportunity to dispatch one duergar and injure the other one severely.

Meanwhile, Aust and Aedan are fighting the creature having burst through the stone doors. It's a large firbolg, quite a bit larger still than Aedan already is. Aust has some trouble resisting Grimjaw'ss blows, but they manage to hold him off. The two duergar that left Nildar's position reappear at the southern door, throwing javelins at Aust and Aedan. Aedan quickly runs for cover and throws a bottle of alchemist's fire at the hall behind Grimjaw, setting Grimjaw and part of the hall on fire.

The one duergar up top was quickly dispatched, and then I left Santiago with Nildar and ran back to the others with Rotom. Seeing the immense firbolg fighting Aust and Aedan, I decided to give it a shot and use a blood curse to limit its attack and movement capabilities. This gives Aust the chance needed to deliver the final blow and disengage from the firbolg and duergar in the tunnel.

The duergar still standing in the hallway assess their chances, not liking them, and taking off toward a rope bridge behind them. Aedan and I quickly run up to the hallway and fire several bolts and arrows, enhanced with the burning alchemist's fire, taking them down.

Santiago was still in Nildar's room, having a friendly chat with them. Somehow having managed to take Nildar's war pick off his hands and convincing them to take off their metal armor, leaving them in a simple vest. Agreeing to Santiago's suggesting it's been a long day and that Nildar should catch some sleep, Nildar settles down into one of the large beds and tries to sleep again.

Nildar says to Santiago: Say hi to uncle Derth in Caer Dineval
