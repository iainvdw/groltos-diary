# Session 13
We search for shelter outside the duergar outpost. Aedan finds a building with a view on the monolith, although it's a bit damp and mildewy.

Aust, Aedan and I take watch during the night.

A white moth appears on the mushrooms, flies away, multiplying time after time again, until a swirling maelstrom appears, turning into a bloodied white cloak with red stars, an elf with obsidian skin and white hair appearing from it. It's Omareth!

Hovers above us, asks for my blood. Rime wakes from his meditation, sees Omareth and tries to cast a spell to bind him. It fails. Santiago wakes up and also tries a spell, which fails as well. Omareth retributes with seven magic missiles. I try to calm everybody down, offer my hand and Omareth takes a small needle with which he takes a drop of my blood.

He looks me in the eye and says:
"Delban is coming, and I am his herald"

We get out of the building and go towards the cave entrance. Rotom scouts ahead and whispers down the hallway that all is clear.
