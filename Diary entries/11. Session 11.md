# Session 11
We dusted ourselves off after the confrontation with the invisible duergar. Everybody got roughed up a bit, but we managed to get out of the ambush pretty okay. In the meanwhile [[Santiago]] was still eyeing up [[Kingsporth]] and the mechanized suit, lifting him in the steering compartment to see if he would fit, to no avail. Seeing me looking at him, Santiago motioned for me to come have a look. I took a moment gauging the machine, but I couldn't fathom how this would work without additional tools and materials. [[Bailon the Beardless|Bailon]] mentions that the blacksmiths in [[Deep Delver's Enclave]] might know how to make it work. 

Hearing this, we figured we might want to take the suit with us to have someone look at it. Following Bailon, we start dragging the mech suit through various paths and caverns, until we reached a large cavern. Deep down below, we saw what looked like an abandoned stone city. Various stone buildings of different shapes and sizes, no light to be seen. Bailon mentioned it's ancient, has been here for a long time. Opposite of the cavern, we see [[Deep Delver's Enclave]]. From over here we saw a massive black column rise from the middle of the settlement, covered in orange glowing runes. We continued our path towards the city and reached it not long after.

Soon after we arrive in the enclave, we saw a couple of kids running past us, chased of by a dwarven woman with a rolling pin. Bailon welcomes us to Deep Delver's Enclave. Introduced the town's purpose, mining the growing metal. They apparently give kids a look inside the mines where it's safe. Asking whether some mining would be unsafe, Bailon says that some of the caverns haven't been fully explored yet and some danger might lurk in the dark. Bailon also mentions that the abandoned city down below also hasn't been fully explored yet. It's large, mysterious and strange markings of red stars are found throughout the city. The abandoned city's name was Shadowreach.

The dwarven woman returns, gesturing to Bailon to come over. The woman speaks to Bailon in dwarvish about a missing goat. Hearing this, I walk over and inquire about this missing goat.

================================

Bailon starts consoling woman. I hear her talking about losing Gary, a good boy. We reach out to them, see what's wrong. Woman named [[Sigha]] lost Gary from a pen, a goat. We offer to look for the goat. More has been stolen or lost around town.

Tavern around, Lucky Lute. We walk in to ask around. More stuff stolen. Dwarven tracks.

Aedan asks about the abandoned city. Woman with an eye patch is researching the city. Followed around by a pack of kobolds. Rotom doesn't want to go see this woman. Driving a hard bargain for information.

Hired pack of kobolds, including Rotom, initially back in the day. Vellynne Harpell. Prestigious family on town of Longsaddle. Cold dispassionate woman. Joined school of magic, mostly because of her name instead of her talents. Magic didn't come as easy to her as her class mate. Travels with a snowy owl. Pack of kobolds didn't like Rotom "borrowing", threw her out of the pack.

Vellynne walks into the bar. Orders a strong drink. Santiago walks up and talks to her. Small talk about her business here. City down below had been populated thousands of years. Magocracy once, city of mages. Santiago asks about greater restoration spell. Wants a favour for helping the king. Look for lady colleague in a lone cabin north of Maer Dualdon. Wants us to find Nass Lantomir. She is from Luskan, from the Arcane Brotherhood. More mages are around here. Vellynne suggests investing more into the friendship with Bailon instead of Baerick.

I ask her about Crenshinibon. Interesting origins, not of this world. Crenshinibon _is_ the metal. Metal is kind of a root system, kind of an organism. Magocracy of the Red Star was interested in it as well. People having strange dreams here, spirits and apparitions, delusions. There was a competing magocracy, Netheril? Colleague believes it comes from the stars.

Offer help. Kobold was killed, Egu. Kobolds do various tasks for Vellynne. Asks us about a face in the rock. Creature in the mountain, Gorom? Old as the mountain. Vellynne wants to ask it some questions. Say we keep an eye out.

Mention to Rotom that one of the kobolds died. Very sad to hear that news. Rotom Aedan sees pack of kobolds, mentions to Rotom. Aust says three of the six have expired, undead. Rotom says hello. One of them stops and sees Rotom. Egu bumps into the one talking. Rotom very distraught to see some of them dead/undead.

We go to the common house to talk to Bailon. Boulette(?) on its roof. Filled with people inside, around 15 people. Board inside filled with notes, about missing stuff. We ask guard to let us in to talk to Bailon. Creatures seem to be able to go invisible and stealing stuff.

Ask about his relationship with king Baerick, they seem to have been friends until the king went mad about 15 years ago. He wants to help out to help the king. Offers to help if we help with the local thefts.

Meet Jayce Goldsmile, a deep gnome. From Blingdenstone. Passages from the Underdark. Runs a small artifact shop on the Evershade Bazaar near the column. Missing spectacles, quite precious. Heard a faint high pitched squabble, like mice arguing in Undercommon. Mentioned lenses specifically, other one suggested to take tools instead. Heard noise come from counter and disappeared. Manufactures mechanical stuff, specialises in glass stuff.

Santiago informs about the mechanized suit. Bailon offers to pay up the cost for the mech suit.

I vaguely ask about a mage studying these mountains, other than Vellynne. Bailon suggests to talk to Gorom. Gorom is in the Halls of the Protectors. Kind of an oracle. Communicates in dreams and visions. In one of the tunnels in Shadowreach. Bailon offers a guide to help us navigate Shadowreach.
