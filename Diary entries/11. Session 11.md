# Session 11
Santiago tries to fit [[Kingsporth]] into the mech suit. Santiago and I take a look if we could make it work, but can't figure out something meaningful. Bailon says their blacksmiths might take a look. We start dragging the mech suit.

We follow Bailon further into the mountain. Reach a cavern, abandoned stone city below. Opposite of the cavern we see the enclave. We walk over to it. Massive black metal column rising from the centre, glowing orange runes coming off of it. Kids run by, woman chasing them off with a rolling pin.

Bailon says the take kids around the mines where it's safe. Danger in the mines, not fully cleared out yet. City below is not fully explored yet, strange markings found there of red stars.

Bailon starts consoling woman. I hear her talking about losing Gary, a good boy. We reach out to them, see what's wrong. Woman named [[Sigha]] lost Gary from a pen, a goat. We offer to look for the goat. More has been stolen or lost around town.
