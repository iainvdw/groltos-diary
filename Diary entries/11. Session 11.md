# Session 11
Santiago tries to fit [[Kingsporth]] into the mech suit. Santiago and I take a look if we could make it work, but can't figure out something meaningful. Bailon says their blacksmiths might take a look. We start dragging the mech suit.

We follow Bailon further into the mountain. Reach a cavern, abandoned stone city below. Opposite of the cavern we see the enclave. We walk over to it. Massive black metal column rising from the centre, glowing orange runes coming off of it. Kids run by, woman chasing them off with a rolling pin.

Bailon says the take kids around the mines where it's safe. Danger in the mines, not fully cleared out yet. City below is not fully explored yet, strange markings found there of red stars. City is called Shadow Reach.

Bailon starts consoling woman. I hear her talking about losing Gary, a good boy. We reach out to them, see what's wrong. Woman named [[Sigha]] lost Gary from a pen, a goat. We offer to look for the goat. More has been stolen or lost around town.

Tavern around, Lucky Lute. We walk in to ask around. More stuff stolen. Dwarven tracks.

Aedan asks about the abandoned city. Woman with an eye patch is researching the city. Followed around by a pack of kobolds. Rotom doesn't want to go see this woman. Driving a hard bargain for information.

Hired pack of kobolds, including Rotom, initially back in the day. Vellynne Harpell. Prestigious family on town of Longsaddle. Cold dispassionate woman. Joined school of magic, mostly because of her name instead of her talents. Magic didn't come as easy to her as her class mate. Travels with a snowy owl. Pack of kobolds didn't like Rotom "borrowing", threw her out of the pack.

Vellynne walks into the bar. Orders a strong drink. Santiago walks up and talks to her. Small talk about her business here. City down below had been populated thousands of years. Magocracy once, city of mages. Santiago asks about greater restoration spell. Wants a favour for helping the king. Look for lady colleague in a lone cabin north of Maer Dualdon. Wants us to find Nass Lantomir. She is from Luskan, from the Arcane Brotherhood. More mages are around here. Vellynne suggests investing more into the friendship with Bailon instead of Baerick.

I ask her about Crenshinibon. Interesting origins, not of this world. Crenshinibon _is_ the metal. Metal is kind of a root system, kind of an organism. Magocracy of the Red Star was interested in it as well. People having strange dreams here, spirits and apparitions, delusions. There was a competing magocracy, Netheril? Colleague believes it comes from the stars.

Offer help. Kobold was killed, Egu. Kobolds do various tasks for Vellynne. Asks us about a face in the rock. Creature in the mountain, Gorom? Old as the mountain. Vellynne wants to ask it some questions. Say we keep an eye out.

Mention to Rotom that one of the kobolds died. Very sad to hear that news. Rotom Aedan sees pack of kobolds, mentions to Rotom. Aust says three of the six have expired, undead. Rotom says hello. One of them stops and sees Rotom. Egu bumps into the one talking. Rotom very distraught to see some of them dead/undead.

We go to the common house to talk to Bailon. Boulette(?) on its roof. Filled with people inside, around 15 people. Board inside filled with notes, about missing stuff. We ask guard to let us in to talk to Bailon. Creatures seem to be able to go invisible and stealing stuff.

Ask about his relationship with king Baerick, they seem to have been friends until the king went mad about 15 years ago. He wants to help out to help the king. Offers to help if we help with the local thefts.

Meet Jayce Goldsmile, a deep gnome. From Blingdenstone. Passages from the Underdark. Runs a small artifact shop on the Evershade Bazaar near the column. Missing spectacles, quite precious. Heard a faint high pitched squabble, like mice arguing in Undercommon. Mentioned lenses specifically, other one suggested to take tools instead. Heard noise come from counter and disappeared. Manufactures mechanical stuff, specialises in glass stuff.

Santiago informs about the mechanized suit. Bailon offers to pay up the cost for the mech suit.

I vaguely ask about a mage studying these mountains, other than Vellynne. Bailon suggests to talk to Gorom. Gorom is in the Halls of the Protectors. Kind of an oracle. Communicates in dreams and visions. In one of the tunnels in Shadowreach. Bailon offers a guide to help us navigate Shadowreach.
