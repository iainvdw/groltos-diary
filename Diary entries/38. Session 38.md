Santiago shouts up toward Theruun.

Nothics attack us. Nothic figure on magical hand flying towards us, leading the pack.

Santiago hypnotizes two of the Nothics. We dispatch the rest of them, including the magical hand.

I loot the corpse of the Nothic leader and find a spellbook and a weird, origami looking key. I get the sense the key has a feel of conjuration magic about it.

We go look for the tower matching the key, Aedan and I lead the group. Within the hour, we find the matching tower, the tower of conjuration. I insert the origami key and the lock frees up to twist. We open the door and find a spiralling staircase up to the top of the tower.

In the top room, there is a pedestal with four glowing hand symbols on each of its sides, and a miniature version of the tower we are in on top of it. Three brooms float about the room, continuously cleaning the floor. We can look inside the miniature tower, but it doesn't seem to have a pedestal in it.

We look at the pedestal, then to each other, and we all place our hands on the symbols. The brooms clatter to the ground, inanimate. A portal opens in the wall, and Santiago walks in. The miniature tower lights up with small flash and we hear a high pitched voice coming from it.

We go through the portal and find ourselves in a room with a celestial standing in a resting position being surrounded by four magical orbs, crackling with energy. In its hands it's holding a key. We poke at the orbs with a broom and the angel's face contorts with pain. As soon as we stop poking, it comes to rest again.

Looking around the room, we find writing in Elven and Draconic, saying "Second, summon a flame in the palm of your hand‚Äù.

Santiago looks around the room, tries to analyze its magic and then walks up to the celestial and pulls at the key. It comes loose after some prying, but as soon as it's loose, we hear the door closing behind us.

Santiago and I make it out, but Aedan and Rime are still in there. An energetic surge can be see from the miniature tower and we see the two small figures of Aedan and Rime being tossed against the walls. Santiago and I don't hesitate for a moment and we put our hands on the pedestal again to try and open a new portal for them, which luckily it does.

We head out of this tower with the key and go looking for another tower to explore. We head back to where we were earlier, fighting the Nothics and head south. There we find another tower, linked to the school of abjuration.

The tower is taller than the one before, and feature large blue glowing symbols on its side. The entrance to the tower is an open archway, but Aedan notices some magical symbols along the frame, indicating that this might be protected by a spell.
