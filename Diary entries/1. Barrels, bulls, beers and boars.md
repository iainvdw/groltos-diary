# 1. Barrels, bulls, beers and boars

**14 Nightal - Bryn Shander**

[[Santiago Cruz de los Santos]] and I were in [[Bryn Shander]] at the Festival of the Barreled Bull. Santiago would of course sign up for the drinking competition. While he was in the line to sign up, we met a couple of other locals that would also partake in the competition.

Santiago, two dwarves and an elf were getting themselves absolute pissed with one of the two dwarves winning. It got close between the elf, a local hero named [[Aust Rime]], and a dwarf, [[Zog Trollbane]]. Zog won. Of course it was the dwarf to win a drinking competition...

Afterwards all of us joined together and went outside again. A kobold lady named [[Rotom Moonbane]] seemed to have made a wager with Zog. He seemed willing to wager all of his winnings to see if he could stay on a huge boar. While being absolutely pissed from the competition. Didn't end well for the dwarf. Heh.

I saw a shady figure move through the crowd and while I didn't see it happen immediately, I saw another dwarf drop to his knees, clutching his belly. He seemed to have been stabbed by someone. The same shady figure held a glowing hot knife to the bull's ass, which sent it into a rampage.

Ran up to the unfortunate bugger and shouted for the guards. Saw the shady figure very eager to get away from the situation, so I tried to stop him. Tried one of my blood curses, but failed. Really need to get some more practice with this, need to remember my training... There was a bit of a skirmish, but the guards managed to overpower the shady figure and take him in for questioning at the stockade, run by [[Sheriff Markham Southwell]].

The bull broke free from the pen and rushed into a tent, where a fortune teller lady was inside. Santiago and I managed to save the fortune teller, calmed the boar down and brought him back to his owner, [[Hiln Trollbane]]. Hiln asked us to meet up at the North Look Inn to talk about the situation, as he seemed to have more information.

Meanwhile, the guards learned that the figure was called [[Ernest]] and he was part of a cult called the [[Creed of Auril]]. The poor bugger seemed to be very afraid of something, or someone. Heard he used a ring that made an icicle pierce his chest, killing himself instantly. The guard that did the interrogation, [[Marlon Tayte]], joined up with us as we were on our way towards the tavern to talk to Hiln Trollbane.

We got to the inn fairly quickly and saw Hiln at a table enjoying an ale, recovering from his wounds. Rime took a table by himself and started boasting about his recent adventures. The locals seem to love his stories. Rotom seemed to be more interested in the crowd. 

Hiln told us he met a figure called [[Henrack]] from a merchant caravan that have been visiting the other towns. Human, slick black hair and a cold stare. Henrack seemed a pretty suspicious figure. That and the fact that the caravan had gone through towns where some murders happened recently made it even more suspicious. Hiln talked about Henrack with Ernest, which seemed to have triggered the incident at the boar riding competition. Hiln told us that the caravan went to Targos next and that it would be best for us to start our investigation there. There's a bounty for 300 gold to bring in the killer alive. Half of that when they're dead. Good money. Could use that.

We got some supplies, rented a couple rooms and after a good night's rest, we're going to set out for [[Targos]]. Hope the weather calms down a bit or we'll have to deal with a blizzard...
