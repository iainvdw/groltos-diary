Rime casts a spell to locate Rotom's keys and its signal leads us south.

We go south in the tunnels, pass a grove of trees growing in the cave, thriving, thick with leaves. Aedan touches one of the trees to sense their wellbeing. Hathowyn, elf fey being inside of trees growing in grove in the cave.  Drow went into direction we were heading.

Following the signal further down the tunnel, we reach a larger open cavern where we see a city held in ice, sloped away from us. A central spire sticks out from the centre of the city.

We jump on the city floor and immediately we feel our gravity shift and corrects our stance to be perpendicular to the floor.

Traversing the streets of the city, we figure out that Theruun entered the central spire, but it was protected by a magical shield which we couldn't pass.

We found a door with nine keyholes, that could presumably be opened with Rotom's keyhole.
