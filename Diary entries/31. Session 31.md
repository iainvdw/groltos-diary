# Session 31
**Rotom's dream**

Pale marble floor with black veins, rime on it. Looks up, 300ft high ceiling. Place is huge, alien architecture. Black obelisk, 60ft. Surface marred, covered in arcane runes. Crack in the obelisk, from the base to the middle.

A figure stands near the obelisk, steward of Ythrin.

Rotom has to activate the obelisk to save all of "us" -> people of Ythrin.

Figure mentions ring of keys, looking for them. Rotom shows them, figure mentions that the keys are of their salvation. The ninth tower in the city of Ythrin. Dream takes place in the ninth tower. Rotom asks how to get there and what to do there. To get there, Rotom must pass through... Something he can't think of.

Caverns lead to the city, in a glacier. Ice all around them. Rotom's close to one of the towers, she needs to finds the ninth one. City was powered by a large orb, mythallar.

Rotom asks what we should look out for, steward mentions we should watch out for the crone, woman with an owl face.

Once we get to the ninth tower, find its peak. Large setting stone there, of brilliant white marble. In it is a keyhole, use moonstone keys to turn the lock. Only then will obelisk be able to activate to save the city, at last.

Rotom suddenly stands alone in this room. Calls out for the rest of us, calls echo in the tower. Completely alone.

Rotom investigates the obelisk for a keyhole. No keyhole present, completely covered in runes. As Rotom walks around the obelisk, she finds a couple familiar runes. Tries to memorise the runes. Touches the obelisk, no reaction. Architecture around the obelisk is alien and unfamiliar.

A large faceless creature comes charging at Rotom,
