# Session 31
**Rotom's dream**

Pale marble floor with black veins, rime on it. Looks up, 300ft high ceiling. Place is huge, alien architecture. Black obelisk, 60ft. Surface marred, covered in arcane runes. Crack in the obelisk, from the base to the middle.

A figure stands near the obelisk, steward of Ythrin.

Rotom has to activate the obelisk to save all of "us" -> people of Ythrin.

Figure mentions ring of keys, looking for them. Rotom shows them, figure mentions that the keys are of their salvation. The ninth tower in the city of Ythrin. Dream takes place in the ninth tower. Rotom asks how to get there and what to do there. To get there, Rotom must pass through... Something he can't think of.

Caverns lead to the city, in a glacier. Ice all around them. Rotom's close to one of the towers, she needs to finds the ninth one. City was powered by a large orb, mythallar.

Rotom asks what we should look out for, steward mentions we should watch out for the crone, woman with an owl face.

Once we get to the ninth tower, find its peak. Large setting stone there, of brilliant white marble. In it is a keyhole, use moonstone keys to turn the lock. Only then will obelisk be able to activate to save the city, at last.

Rotom suddenly stands alone in this room. Calls out for the rest of us, calls echo in the tower. Completely alone.

Rotom investigates the obelisk for a keyhole. No keyhole present, completely covered in runes. As Rotom walks around the obelisk, she finds a couple familiar runes. Tries to memorise the runes. Touches the obelisk, no reaction. Architecture around the obelisk is alien and unfamiliar.

A large, purple, faceless creature comes charging at Rotom, and rows and rows of teeth open up from its belly to bite at her...

The Rotom wakes up in cold sweat. Screams about many teeth, coming for us. Also mutters stuff about a tower, obelisk and saving people.

Santiago and I try to get Rotom to make some sense.

Obelisk: familiar, matches one in mountain.

Save people of Ythrin, even though city fell down ages ago. Rotom belives there are people there that need saving.

**Aedan's books**

Vellynne helps Aedan translate the books. The professor orb translates the titles of the books, most of them not really interesting.

Taught magic to the cloud giants of Astoria in a bygone empire. Details how magic of Netheril came about, how they became a powerful magocracy. Scrolls are a build up to that power, magic not safe for mortals, but the Netherese managed to acquire them and utilise their power.

Ventatost, collections of stories and conspiracy theory. Netherese city that was disintegrated entirely. Drawing of obelisk matching what Rotom described. Obelisk was source of disintegration.

**Continue  towards Reghed Glacier**

First day, clear day of travel.

Santiago travels next to the tiefling and slowly starts agonising Avarice, to try and see if she gives up something in anger. Avarice manages to keep her calm, but Kadroth has more trouble. He tries to figure out Avarice's intentions, Santiago spots her glancing at me a few times. At some point, Avarice has had enough of him and finally banishes his axe beak out from under him and he falls into the snow.

Santiago polymorphs himself to run up to me and mentions this. I tell Santiago about Avarice's ritual, communing with Levistus, and that she knows that I know. Might be why she's glancing over at me all  the time.

Avarice says the she was communing with Levistus to ask for better directions. Could take 20 days to traverse Reghed Glacier from south to north.

Second day, blizzard picks up pretty heavy.

Santiago starts casting the tiny hut to shelter from the storm, but before he manages to finish the spell, all but me get blown away.

Rime hears a voice in his mind from his sword, "I don't know where the rest is, but one is to the right". Rime moves in that direction and finds Aedan.

In the distance, I can see Avarice, a soft blue glow coming from her staff.

I can hear Rotom's horn, blasting it to call out her position.

Invoking my rite on my crossbow so it starts glowing red, I hold it in the air as a beacon for others to see and start calling out, while walking in Rotom's direction.
