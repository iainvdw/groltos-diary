# Session Six
There she was, the elven woman standing behind the desk of Sune's Comfort and Hot Springs. [[Amala Bhilar]], with her blonde hair and shining bright blue eyes. She welcomed us as soon as we walked in, seeming to hope we were patrons of her establishment. 

Her hope seemed to fade a bit soon as we started introducing ourselves and explaining the reason why we were there, because Oarus told us she had problems with the monster from the lake. Recently, a monster in the lake started scaring Amala's patrons away when they were enjoying some time in the hot springs. Less and less people started coming, afraid of the monster reappearing. With fewer people coming to the hot springs, the appearances of the monster reduced. When we asked her if the monster ever spoke to her or her clientele, she seemed surprised at the question. She never heard the monster speak or someone mentioning it.

Asking about her eyes, Amala told us that she was born on mid-winter's day and as such, she became blessed by Auril. It seemed to make her not mind the cold so much, but made her less withstanding of heat. Funny that she's running the _hot_ springs then. She did mention that she was not a follower of Auril as she disapproved of Auril's cruelty. Instead, she was a follower of Sune, the deity of beauty and love.

Suddenly, the elemental lantern I carried with me turned green and we heard loud screams coming from downstairs. Santiago drew his sword and rushed downstairs. I ran after Santiago down the stairs, when I heard Amala shouting at us. "Stop, it's not what you think!". I ran back up to ask what she meant. She told me that she had some animals downstairs and that the screaming was not caused by something dangerous, but by some being that seemed to visit the establishment.

Together with Amala I ran down the stairs towards the others, to find Santiago and a 



- Start at Sune's Comfort and Hot Springs
- Auril blessed Amala with a frost resistance boon?
- A druid, Ravisin, visited Amala to ask if she wanted to join her cause, related to Auril. Take back the land, end the Rime. Long black hair. From Lonelywood. Place was only visible to elvish races.
- Lake monster was scaring customers
- Elemental lantern went green, found monkeys downstairs screaming, a Chwinga was annoying the monkeys

- Chwinga seems to communicate through smells.
	- Lemon: friendly
	- Ham: ?
	- Tar: ?
	- Honeysuckle -> its name
	- Violet: scared
	The Chwinga seemed to put a spell on Aust, blessed him with some boon.

Lake monster came up, talked to us. Said it gained intelligence and the ability to speak in exchange for scaring fishermen and Amala's customers.

Amala was going to help us with Oarus.

Amala also mentioned that the Creed of Auril split of from the Church of Auril, but that they were more extreme.

Ravisin the druid was probably part of some elven druid circle. That circle was founded by Sahnar of Luruar (?). Ward of Mallieki and keeper of Lonelywood Grove.

Amala also agreed to help us with Oarus' election speech. Do a ceremony for the killed miners.

When Oarus' gave his speech, talking about the recent victories and incoming help with the food situation, the crowd seems pretty pleased with how Oarus' dealt with recent stuff. People started clapping.

Drank with some people at the Blue Clam. Santiago found a guard, fed him drunk and gained some information on Pippa, Nearth and the sacrifices. Pippa came from Luskan and received some kind of green flying snakes.

Found the shed with Torrga's sleds and gear open. We investigated, found a broken off frozen pinky finger and some oily foot steps. Also there were some tracks leading away from the shed, leading north.

We gathered the others and went on the way to Oarus. The town hall's doors were open, we decided to investigate. The hall was empty and dark and no one present. There were 5 dead people in the cells, they were Torrga and her folk. We found oily tracks in the town hall as well.

Marlon and Aust found a singing zombie on the docks. They had a bit of a skirmish with it, it tried to push Marlon into the water. Eventually it was overpowered and they brought it back into Sune's Comfort and Hot Springs. Amala was called out to see if she could help with the zombie. She recognized the zombie as the clerk from town hall. All of them dragged the still singing zombie back toward the town hall.

Meanwhile, we gathered Oarus and told him about the situation. We went back to town hall and showed him the dead prisoners. Rotom did some extra investigation and found a small scribbling of a rose on a painting.
