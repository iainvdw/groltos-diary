# Session Six
- Start at Sune's Comfort and Hot Springs
- Auril blessed Amala with a frost resistance boon?
- A druid, Ravisin, visited Amala to ask if she wanted to join her cause, related to Auril. Take back the land, end the Rime. Long black hair. From Lonelywood. Place was only visible to elvish races.
- Lake monster was scaring customers
- Elemental lantern went green, found monkeys downstairs screaming, a Chwinga was annoying the monkeys

- Chwinga seems to communicate through smells.
	- Lemon: friendly
	- Ham: ?
	- Tar: ?
	- Honeysuckle -> its name
	- Violet: scared
	The Chwinga seemed to put a spell on Aust, blessed him with some boon.

Lake monster came up, talked to us. Said it gained intelligence and the ability to speak in exchange for scaring fishermen and Amala's customers.

Amala was going to help us with Oarus.

Amala also mentioned that the Creed of Auril split of from the Church of Auril, but that they were more extreme.

Ravisin the druid was probably part of some elven druid circle. Leader of that circle is Sahnar of Luruar (?). Ward of Mallieki and keeper of Lonelywood Grove.

Amala also agreed to help us with Oarus' election speech. Do a ceremony for the killed miners.

When Oarus' gave his speech, talking about the recent victories and incoming help with the food situation, the crowd seems pretty pleased with how Oarus' dealt with recent stuff. People started clapping.
