We enter the arboretum, looking at the few trees still standing here. Suddenly Aedan notices some drow trying to sneak up on us from behind. Aedan warns us and casts web on the group to stop them advancing on us.

Combat ensues, arrows and bolts are fired, swords slash through the air and spells are cast. Some of the drow mention to their own mage that spells shouldn't be cast here, as it's dangerous. The mage doesn't listen and casts spells anyway.

Some time later during the combat, the earth starts trembling a bit after some spells are cast. A few more monsters appear, tomb tappers. They seem to be targeting spellcasters first, turning their attention towards anyone casting spells.

One drow left after battle, telling us about Xorlarinn Baenre, boss of drow, has six keys.
