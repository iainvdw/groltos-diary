## Session 14
Short rest

I talk to the two caged dwarves, man and woman, patchy beards, malnourished. Ask about how they got here, were researching Shadowreach. Snatched by grey dwarves. Duergar asked about shadowreach, deep delver's enclave, defenses, magical objects. Not sure why. I free them from the cage by smashing the lock.

We find them clothes and Aedan gives them a goodberry each. I ask them if they saw anyone else. They mention the firbolg and an elf with obsidian skin, white hair and cloak.

We off Nildar in his sleep. Explore the fortress.
