## Session 14
Short rest

I talk to the two caged dwarves, man and woman, patchy beards, malnourished. Ask about how they got here, were researching Shadowreach. Snatched by grey dwarves. Duergar asked about Shadowreach, deep delver's enclave, defenses, magical objects. Not sure why. I free them from the cage by smashing the lock.

We find them clothes and Aedan gives them a goodberry each. I ask them if they saw anyone else. They mention the firbolg and an elf with obsidian skin, white hair and cloak.

We off Nildar in his sleep. 

Explore the fortress. Take Nildar's armor and axe. Find 154 gold. Crumpled note. Two silver daggers. Pouch with a topaz worth 200gp. Two onyx stones worth 50gp each. Platinum ore worth 2300gp. In Grimjaw's chamber, I find an elven broach of drow make, pool bathing in moonlight, made of silver. Around 350gp. Hidden from the duergar, probably Grimjaw's only last possession.

Santiago's note said in Dwarvish:

> Keep it coming! we're more then halfway there. Once the frozen ferry is filled, we shall descend the red waters. Long may our father reign over this dark land!

> Durth

We discuss about how to deal with the chardalyn. Rime conjures four black bears that start pushing the crates of chardalyn. Santiago wants to bring some chardalyn back to [[Deep Delver's Enclave]].

We pack up and leave, walk to [[Bailon the Beardless|Bailon]] and tell what happened. Happy to hear most of the stuff is still there and ready to be picked up. Writes a writ for a stay at the Lucky Lute free of charge.

Rotom notices Bailon tugging on Santiago's sleeve as we walk out. Ask what he was doing and suggests to walk outside with us. Bailon assures us that it's an accident and had nothing to share.

We head into the Lucky Lute and get some needed rest. During the night I inspect the silver broach I found. It's a silver broach of a drow goddess, Eilistraee. good aligned, goddess of moonlight = 350gp

Santiago identifies the armor and warpick for us. The armor is mithral half plate, which Aedan takes.

We want to sell the loot we found, but most of the vendors seem to have left in town.

Later in the day, vendors come back carrying sacks of stuff. Probably the missing stuff from town. I head to [[Jayce Goldsmile|Jayce]] as soon as I see she's back, looking for an upgrade for my gear. She has a lens for my hand crossbow, and a light crossbow of warning. 500gp for the lens and 900gp for the light crossbow of warning. Santiago steps in and starts negotiating a better price for the stuff. Offering Jayce a date with me in return for a decent discount on the stuff. Jayce seems really into it and offers me all the stuff for 800gp. Santiago suddenly offers to pay up 400gp,
