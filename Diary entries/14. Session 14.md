## Session 14
Short rest

I talk to the two caged dwarves, man and woman, patchy beards, malnourished. Ask about how they got here, were researching Shadowreach. Snatched by grey dwarves. Duergar asked about Shadowreach, deep delver's enclave, defenses, magical objects. Not sure why. I free them from the cage by smashing the lock.

We find them clothes and Aedan gives them a goodberry each. I ask them if they saw anyone else. They mention the firbolg and an elf with obsidian skin, white hair and cloak.

We off Nildar in his sleep. 

Explore the fortress. Take Nildar's armor and axe. Find 154 gold. Crumpled note. Two silver daggers. Pouch with a topaz worth 200gp. Two onyx stones worth 50gp each. Platinum ore worth 2300gp. In Grimjaw's chamber, I find an elven broach of drow make, pool bathing in moonlight, made of silver. Around 350gp. Hidden from the duergar, probably Grimjaw's only last possession.

Santiago's note said in Dwarvish:

We discuss about how to deal with the chardalyn. Rime conjures four black bears that start pushing the crates of chardalyn.
