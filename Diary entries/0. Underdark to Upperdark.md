**18 Uktar - Blingdenstone**

Tomorrow we will set out toward the surface. I'm leading an expedition of about 80 of my kin to escape the impending assault on Blingdenstone. There's no clue why the duergar would suddenly want to attack our home, it came out of nowhere. I'll try to get some rest before we head out.

...out of nowhere! The assault came sooner than expected, had to leave early. Didn't manage to find everybody from the expedition I'm leading. Found only 35 people or so. Had to battle some duergar on the way out of the city, we managed to hold them off and protect most of the group, we lost 3 people in the battle. Now
