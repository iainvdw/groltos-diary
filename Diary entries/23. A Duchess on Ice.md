# A Duchess on Ice
We follow the orcs back to their encampment, which is decorated with goblin heads on pikes.

Goblins near a bronze bell to the north. The was a strange altar with a beam across it and the bell hung from it.

Goblins have a fortress to the south near the mountains. Orcs had been able to capture some goblin patrols. There's a wagon they managed to take from the goblins which was full of dwarven iron. Ingot contains a stamp of two ale mugs clanking together.

Ship is frequented a lot by seals to get out of the wind, taking shelter in or near the wreckage. Orcs have been getting some good game from that location.

Stay for the night in the orc encampment. We take off in the morning and our journey goes rather uneventful. We arrive at the ship in the early afternoon.

The ship is covered in frost, it creaks and moans in the wind. We hear thumping coming from the ship, followed by a guttural growl.

Large footprints, seem humanoid, but have four toes. Seemingly undead. Aedan confirms my suspicions. Also, I see some marks in the snow that would be from a walrus or seal. 

Santiago lifts Rotom on his shoulders so she could see on deck, but the deck is empty. Santiago takes Rotom around to scout the ship. They find some port holes on the front side of the ship. Looking in, two empty rooms covered in frost and parchment. Rotom gets inside through the port hole, Santiago helps pushing her in. She finds a map inside and throws it outside through the port hole.

As Rotom does so, a spectral figure appears beside her, telling that the maps was theirs.

I case the ship walking to the front. Walking along the bow of the ship, I hear a guttural growl again. With the undead tracks we spotted and this beastly sound, I ready my crossbow with a crimson rite.

Get on deck with help of Knobsworth. See glistening coming down from the hold. Taking a closer look, I notice it is coming from a pile covered in ice. Under the ice I notice coins, jewelry and other various items, seemingly the treasure hoard that Santiago told us about.

Dropping to my belly to take a better look into the hold, I notice the source of the guttural  sound. It's coming from a troll gnawing on a piece of raw seal meat. Doesn't notice me. I get up and tell in a low voice to the others that there's a troll. Aust mentions that we need to kill it with fire.

Aust spots Santiago appearing in a hallway, tells him there's a troll. Santiago mentions there's a ghost, navigator of the ship. Knobsworth asks us where we would like the fire, Aedan tells him to position himself near the staircase. While Knobsworth clanks over the deck, the troll stops eating and starts looking around, noticing me with an angry look and dropping his meal. As the troll spots me, I take my crossbow and fire twice at it. I miss once, almost dropping my crossbow, but I manage to hold on to it. I fire the second time, hitting it, enraging it even further.

Aust and Aedan drop down in the hold and start attacking the troll as well. Aust manages to instill some fear in the troll. Santiago and Rotom rush in from the north side of the ship. Santiago tries to hypnotise the troll with a spell, but the troll manages to resist. 

The troll runs off in fear of Aust and bashes into Knobsworth, denting its armour greatly and hurting Knobsworth. It knocks the flamethrower off the armour. Knobsworth runs up the stairs to the deck again, shouting to me that the troll has got it in for him. I run past him down the stairs and fire three bolts from my crossbow, causing it to drop to the floor. Aedan and Aust mention we need fire to permanently deal with it, so Rotom takes out a torch and lights it, to then burn the troll's flesh with it. This seems to have dealt with the troll.

Rotom and Santiago notice the massive pile of frozen treasure and Rotom starts to hug the ice wall. Santiago casts his tiny hut as close to the icy face as possible to try and melt it.

Aedan searches the back hold of the ship, finds a couple of frozen water barrels.

Aust finds a diary in the front part of the hold, written in common.

Aust and I search the aft castle, but the door is frozen shut. Aust casts prestidigitation to melt the ice. There's a body on the floor wearing a jacket and a hat, holding a journal under its arm. In an alcove tucked under the stairs is a chest, which I try to open. Its frozen shut, but Aust does the same trick again to open it.

Inside the chest is a wooden partition, leather pouches, large golden bracelet, larger bag made of grey cloth. Inside the larger bag is a quivering fuzzy ball. Taking it out, it spawns a massive dire wolf. Surprised by this sudden appearance, we both await its action. It seems to just stand there, looking at me, waiting for something like a command. We come to the conclusion this is a magic bag of tricks, which allows us to summon random magic items. The leather pouch contains 150gp, 525sp.

Aust helps Rotom and Santiago to melt the ice.
