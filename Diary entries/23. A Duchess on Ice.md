# A Duchess on Ice
We follow the orcs back to their encampment, which is decorated with goblin heads on pikes.

Goblins near a bronze bell to the north. The was a strange altar with a beam across it and the bell hung from it.

Goblins have a fortress to the south near the mountains. Orcs had been able to capture some goblin patrols. There's a wagon they managed to take from the goblins which was full of dwarven iron. Ingot contains a stamp of two ale mugs clanking together.

Ship is frequented a lot by seals to get out of the wind, taking shelter in or near the wreckage. Orcs have been getting some good game from that location.

Stay for the night in the orc encampment. We take off in the morning and our journey goes rather uneventful. We arrive at the ship in the early afternoon.

The ship is covered in frost, it creaks and moans in the wind. We hear thumping coming from the ship, followed by a guttural growl.

Large footprints, seem humanoid, but have four toes. Seemingly undead. Aedan confirms my suspicions. Also, I see some marks in the snow that would be from a walrus or seal. 

Santiago lifts Rotom on his shoulders so she could see on deck, but the deck is empty. Santiago takes Rotom around to scout the ship. They find some port holes on the front side of the ship. Looking in, two empty rooms covered in frost and parchment. Rotom gets inside through the port hole, Santiago helps pushing her in. She finds a map inside and throws it outside through the port hole.

As Rotom does so, a spectral figure appears beside her, telling that the maps was theirs.

I case the ship walking to the front. Walking along the bow of the ship, I hear a guttural growl again. With the undead tracks we spotted and this beastly sound, I ready my crossbow with a crimson rite.
