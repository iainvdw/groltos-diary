# A Duchess on Ice
We follow the orcs back to their encampment, which is decorated with goblin heads on pikes.

Goblins near a bronze bell to the north. The was a strange altar with a beam across it and the bell hung from it.

Goblins have a fortress to the south near the mountains. Orcs had been able to capture some goblin patrols. There's a wagon they managed to take from the goblins which was full of dwarven iron. Ingot contains a stamp of two ale mugs clanking together.

Ship is frequented a lot by seals to get out of the wind, taking shelter in or near the wreckage. Orcs have been getting some good game from that location.

Stay for the night in the orc encampment. We take off in the morning and our journey goes rather uneventful. We arrive at the ship in the early afternoon.
