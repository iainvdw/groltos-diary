# A Duchess on Ice
**3 Hammer - Orc encampment**

Following the orcs back to their encampment, we eventually reach a small orcish village made up of tents and yurts. Poles and stakes decorated with goblin heads are put up outside and around the camp.

A large fire is lit in the middle of the camp, while some orcs butcher the hunted mammoth for a feast. There is music, drinking and dancing, but not in a way we're used to in [[Ten Towns]].

Asking about the goblin heads, the orcs tell us that they found goblins to the north and south of here. There were some goblins near a bronze bell, which was hung from a weird altar. Apparently the goblins ran off with the bell.

To the south, the orcs found a fortified goblin fortress. They have managed to intercept some goblin patrols and caravans, capturing them and their supplies. Pointing to a wagon in the camp, the orcs tell us that it's filled to the brim with dwarven metal. Curious as to what kind of metal, I ask if I could see the wagon. I can see the orcs don't fully trust us, telling us we can't see it. One of them does get up and walks over to the cart, bringing me a single bar of metal. Inspecting it, I'm relieved to see it isn't chardalyn, as it is actually an iron ingot stamped with a dwarven mark of two mugs of ale clanking together.

The orcs hear us talking about the ship and tell us they've seen it too. It's some ways to the north of the camp. The ship is frequented by a lot of seals who want to get out of the wind and take shelter in or near the wreckage. They have been getting some good game from there during their hunts.

Feasting our way into the night with the orcs, enjoying a good drink and some freshly cooked mammoth meat, we eventually settle for the night to rest up for the remainder of the journey towards [[The Dark Duchess]]. We leave early in the morning, our heads still somewhat heavy from the evening before. The journey north goes rather uneventful, and we finally see the silhouette of the ship pop up through the veil of the falling snow.

We reach the ship in the early afternoon, seeing that it's covered in frost, its wood creaking and moaning in the strong winds. It lies a bit sideways in the ice, the deck rising to its starboard side. A thumping noise emanates from within the hull of the ship, followed by a guttural growl. Tracks can be seen around the ship, most of them from seals and walruses, but I also spot imprints in the snow that look humanoid but have four toes, seemingly undead. I imbue my crossbow when I notice this, and notify the others. 

[[Santiago Cruz de los Santos|Santiago]] takes [[Rotom Moonbane|Rotom]] on his shoulders, lifting her up so she can see on deck. Nothing worth noting is to be seen yet. They then start scouting the outer perimeter of the ship, walking northwards around the ship. Meanwhile, [[Aedan]] lifts [[Kingsporth]] on deck and he tells us what he sees. The deck is wrecked and large scratches mark the wood. Knobsworth helps us climb up on deck as well. On deck, we can see this ship used to be a medium sized three-master, its masts now wrecked and broken in the winds. A massive hole has been torn through the upper deck into the hold of the ship.

Looking into the hold, I notice a glimmer coming from below. Taking a better look, I can see metallic objects, gold and jewelry encased in a massive icy wall. I drop prone to better see inside the hold. Then I notice the creature that has been making the thumping and growling noises: an [[Ice Troll]] eating a freshly caught seal, tearing its flesh straight from the carcass. It doesn't seem to notice me yet and goes about eating the seal undisturbed. I mention to the others on deck that there's a troll, Aust and Aedan reply that we should kill it with fire, otherwise it would keep regenerating.

Meanwhile, we see Santiago standing in a corridor in the fore castle of the ship. Aust whispers to him that there's a troll, Santiago whispers back there's a befriended ghost of the ship's navigator and Rotom is discussing a map with it. What is this ship? There's a treasure hoard, a troll, now ghosts?!

Aedan takes up position near the stairs down to the hold and Kingsporth follows suit. When Kingsporth walks over the deck, I notice that the clanking of Kingsporth's suit notifies the ice troll of our presence. Immediately it drops the seal it was eating and scans its surroundings, noticing me looking down into the hold. I shout that the troll has spotted us and start firing my crossbow at it, hitting it with couple shots. Then I attempt to bind the troll in its place using one of my blood curses, but it manages to resist.

Kingsporth and Aedan run down the stairs, while Aust heroically jumps down the hole in the deck into the hold. Kingsporth sears the troll with his flamethrower, searing its flesh causing it to scream out in pain. Aust slashes at it with his warpick, smiting the troll with a furious wrath, and we see fear overcome it as it tries to flee from Aust. Aedan peppers it with arrows, staying out of reach of the troll.

At that moment, we see Santiago and Rotom come running to our aid, followed by a couple of ghosts. Now there are more ghosts on this ship? Santiago only mentioned one! As I turn my gaze and crossbow towards them, I see they're not hostile and also come to aid us in fighting the troll. Santiago tries to hypnotise the troll, but it manages to shrug off the effects of the coloured lights.

Then the troll runs off in fear of Aust, bashing into Knobsworth as it tries to reach the stairs to flee the encounter. It smashes it's fists and claws into Knobsworth's armour, putting massive dents in it and knocking the flamethrower off its arm. In response to this massive barrage, Knobsworth flees up the stairs, screaming at me that it has got it in for him.

As the troll ran out of sight from my position on deck, I run past Knobsworth down the stairs, firing three shots from my crossbow in its abdomen, chest and head. This downs the troll, but as we stand over its body, we can see the wounds start to regenerate. Rotom takes out a torch and lights it, starting to sear the troll with it. For a short moment it writhes in pain as the life starts to leave it.

We take a breather after this encounter, and then Rotom and Santiago notice the massive frozen treasure encased in ice. Rotom's eyes start to glimmer and she walks up to the icy wall, pressing her face against the ice, trying to hug the still unobtainable treasure. Of course, this also attracts Santiago's attention and immediately starts thinking of a plan to melt the ice.

===================

Rotom and Santiago notice the massive pile of frozen treasure and Rotom starts to hug the ice wall. Santiago casts his tiny hut as close to the icy face as possible to try and melt it.

Aedan searches the back hold of the ship, finds a couple of frozen water barrels.

Aust finds a diary in the front part of the hold, written in common.

Aust and I search the aft castle, but the door is frozen shut. Aust casts prestidigitation to melt the ice. There's a body on the floor wearing a jacket and a hat, holding a journal under its arm. In an alcove tucked under the stairs is a chest, which I try to open. Its frozen shut, but Aust does the same trick again to open it.

Inside the chest is a wooden partition, leather pouches, large golden bracelet, larger bag made of grey cloth. Inside the larger bag is a quivering fuzzy ball. Taking it out, it spawns a massive dire wolf. Surprised by this sudden appearance, we both await its action. It seems to just stand there, looking at me, waiting for something like a command. We come to the conclusion this is a magic bag of tricks, which allows us to summon random magic items. The leather pouch contains 150 gold and 525 silver pieces.

Aust helps Rotom and Santiago to melt the ice. They then come back up to scout the fore of the ship. 

Under a bed in the left cabin we find a small iron lockbox. Aust opens it and finds a name on the inside of the lockbox, which says Vaelish Gant. A small item is in there which looks like a brass key, without the key head on it. Engraved in the shaft of the key are several circle with a dot in it. Rotom recognises the engraving in the key with one of her moonstone keys.

We dump all the stuff inside of the dome, and Santiago detects magic on it. Immediately Santiago notices the magic coming off the bag, and several items encased in the ice as well.

I inspect the first mate's room, but find nothing of interest.

Santiago starts interrogating the ghosts. Ship ran on land during a storm, two wizard who were on board were unable to move the ship. Wizards took off, but not before they saw one of the wizards murder the crew and the other wizard. Ghosts never saw this treasure before in their life. Santiago confesses to the ghost that he's the grandfather of the original captain of the ship. 

He asks if the ghosts see his grandfather being murdered. Aust starts reading the captain's journal and as he does so, the captain's ghost exits Santiago's body and floats over to the journal that Aust is holding. The ghost captain floats over to Aust and asks to hold the journal. Aust gives it to him, but it falls through its hands. Santiago shouts to the ghost captain to continue possessing him again. We all look at Santiago _very_ confused, in awe of what's unfolding in front of our eyes. Apparently, he's just an orc who get sent out to fish and got possessed by the ghost captain.

The one remaining wizard set off for Luskan. The captain's log mentions that the wizard found a Lost Spire of Netheril. Rotom's eyes light up when there's mention of a Lost Spire of Netheril.

Aust then goes through the diary, which appears to belong to another wizard, Dzaan. The crew mentions that they lost Dzaan during their travels. The name Dzaan rings a bell, as Oarus told us he was visited by that wizard asking about the lantern.

Rotom suggests that she could be possessed, and one of them approaches. We hear the flapping of titanic wings, a roar and a load thump of claws landing on the ship.
