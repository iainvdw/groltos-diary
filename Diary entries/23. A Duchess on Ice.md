# A Duchess on Ice
**3 Hammer - Orc encampment**

Following the orcs back to their encampment, we eventually reach a small orcish village made up of tents and yurts. Poles and stakes decorated with goblin heads are put up outside and around the camp.

A large fire is lit in the middle of the camp, while some orcs butcher the hunted mammoth for a feast. There is music, drinking and dancing, but not in a way we're used to in [[Ten Towns]].

Asking about the goblin heads, the orcs tell us that they found goblins to the north and south of here. There were some goblins near a bronze bell, which was hung from a weird altar. Apparently the goblins ran off with the bell.

To the south, the orcs found a fortified goblin fortress. They have managed to intercept some goblin patrols and caravans, capturing them and their supplies. Pointing to a wagon in the camp, the orcs tell us that it's filled to the brim with dwarven metal. Curious as to what kind of metal, I ask if I could see the wagon. I can see the orcs don't fully trust us, telling us we can't see it. One of them does get up and walks over to the cart, bringing me a single bar of metal. Inspecting it, I'm relieved to see it isn't chardalyn, as it is actually an iron ingot stamped with a dwarven mark of two mugs of ale clanking together.

The orcs hear us talking about the ship and tell us they've seen it too. It's some ways to the north of the camp. The ship is frequented by a lot of seals who what to get out of the wind and take shelter


=================

Ship is frequented a lot by seals to get out of the wind, taking shelter in or near the wreckage. Orcs have been getting some good game from that location.

Stay for the night in the orc encampment. We take off in the morning and our journey goes rather uneventful. We arrive at the ship in the early afternoon.

The ship is covered in frost, it creaks and moans in the wind. We hear thumping coming from the ship, followed by a guttural growl.

Large footprints, seem humanoid, but have four toes. Seemingly undead. Aedan confirms my suspicions. Also, I see some marks in the snow that would be from a walrus or seal. 

Santiago lifts Rotom on his shoulders so she could see on deck, but the deck is empty. Santiago takes Rotom around to scout the ship. They find some port holes on the front side of the ship. Looking in, two empty rooms covered in frost and parchment. Rotom gets inside through the port hole, Santiago helps pushing her in. She finds a map inside and throws it outside through the port hole.

As Rotom does so, a spectral figure appears beside her, telling that the maps was theirs.

I case the ship walking to the front. Walking along the bow of the ship, I hear a guttural growl again. With the undead tracks we spotted and this beastly sound, I ready my crossbow with a crimson rite.

Get on deck with help of Knobsworth. See glistening coming down from the hold. Taking a closer look, I notice it is coming from a pile covered in ice. Under the ice I notice coins, jewelry and other various items, seemingly the treasure hoard that Santiago told us about.

Dropping to my belly to take a better look into the hold, I notice the source of the guttural  sound. It's coming from a troll gnawing on a piece of raw seal meat. Doesn't notice me. I get up and tell in a low voice to the others that there's a troll. Aust mentions that we need to kill it with fire.

Aust spots Santiago appearing in a hallway, tells him there's a troll. Santiago mentions there's a ghost, navigator of the ship. Knobsworth asks us where we would like the fire, Aedan tells him to position himself near the staircase. While Knobsworth clanks over the deck, the troll stops eating and starts looking around, noticing me with an angry look and dropping his meal. As the troll spots me, I take my crossbow and fire twice at it. I miss once, almost dropping my crossbow, but I manage to hold on to it. I fire the second time, hitting it, enraging it even further.

Aust and Aedan drop down in the hold and start attacking the troll as well. Aust manages to instill some fear in the troll. Santiago and Rotom rush in from the north side of the ship. Santiago tries to hypnotise the troll with a spell, but the troll manages to resist. 

The troll runs off in fear of Aust and bashes into Knobsworth, denting its armour greatly and hurting Knobsworth. It knocks the flamethrower off the armour. Knobsworth runs up the stairs to the deck again, shouting to me that the troll has got it in for him. I run past him down the stairs and fire three bolts from my crossbow, causing it to drop to the floor. Aedan and Aust mention we need fire to permanently deal with it, so Rotom takes out a torch and lights it, to then burn the troll's flesh with it. This seems to have dealt with the troll.

Rotom and Santiago notice the massive pile of frozen treasure and Rotom starts to hug the ice wall. Santiago casts his tiny hut as close to the icy face as possible to try and melt it.

Aedan searches the back hold of the ship, finds a couple of frozen water barrels.

Aust finds a diary in the front part of the hold, written in common.

Aust and I search the aft castle, but the door is frozen shut. Aust casts prestidigitation to melt the ice. There's a body on the floor wearing a jacket and a hat, holding a journal under its arm. In an alcove tucked under the stairs is a chest, which I try to open. Its frozen shut, but Aust does the same trick again to open it.

Inside the chest is a wooden partition, leather pouches, large golden bracelet, larger bag made of grey cloth. Inside the larger bag is a quivering fuzzy ball. Taking it out, it spawns a massive dire wolf. Surprised by this sudden appearance, we both await its action. It seems to just stand there, looking at me, waiting for something like a command. We come to the conclusion this is a magic bag of tricks, which allows us to summon random magic items. The leather pouch contains 150 gold and 525 silver pieces.

Aust helps Rotom and Santiago to melt the ice. They then come back up to scout the fore of the ship. 

Under a bed in the left cabin we find a small iron lockbox. Aust opens it and finds a name on the inside of the lockbox, which says Vaelish Gant. A small item is in there which looks like a brass key, without the key head on it. Engraved in the shaft of the key are several circle with a dot in it. Rotom recognises the engraving in the key with one of her moonstone keys.

We dump all the stuff inside of the dome, and Santiago detects magic on it. Immediately Santiago notices the magic coming off the bag, and several items encased in the ice as well.

I inspect the first mate's room, but find nothing of interest.

Santiago starts interrogating the ghosts. Ship ran on land during a storm, two wizard who were on board were unable to move the ship. Wizards took off, but not before they saw one of the wizards murder the crew and the other wizard. Ghosts never saw this treasure before in their life. Santiago confesses to the ghost that he's the grandfather of the original captain of the ship. 

He asks if the ghosts see his grandfather being murdered. Aust starts reading the captain's journal and as he does so, the captain's ghost exits Santiago's body and floats over to the journal that Aust is holding. The ghost captain floats over to Aust and asks to hold the journal. Aust gives it to him, but it falls through its hands. Santiago shouts to the ghost captain to continue possessing him again. We all look at Santiago _very_ confused, in awe of what's unfolding in front of our eyes. Apparently, he's just an orc who get sent out to fish and got possessed by the ghost captain.

The one remaining wizard set off for Luskan. The captain's log mentions that the wizard found a Lost Spire of Netheril. Rotom's eyes light up when there's mention of a Lost Spire of Netheril.

Aust then goes through the diary, which appears to belong to another wizard, Dzaan. The crew mentions that they lost Dzaan during their travels. The name Dzaan rings a bell, as Oarus told us he was visited by that wizard asking about the lantern.

Rotom suggests that she could be possessed, and one of them approaches. We hear the flapping of titanic wings, a roar and a load thump of claws landing on the ship.

"Ready your spells Meltharond, we have got some intruders."
