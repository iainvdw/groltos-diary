# Session 10

Earthquake. Avalanche. 

Three spikes from the ground. Malleable metal, similar to shard in Rotom's possession.

Dwarves on goats arrive. We tell them we're on official business from Termalaine. Takes a bit of convincing to tell the female dwarven captain, Girsa Splintersword?

We travel with the dwarves to their settlement, Battlehammer Hold. Great stone door. We enter hallway, quite empty. Santiago asks about the scarcity of dwarves in the settlement. Dwarves pushed into the mountain to mine the metal, emptying the hold up top. Queen didn't want the settlement to be emptied for the mining.

The captain takes us to a tavern, Dumathoins Ale. I talk to the bartender, asking about the empty halls. Queen didn't want the dwarves to mine because of the king going mad because of the metal. Rumours of a couple of dwarves going mad as well, but the bartender didn't know anyone himself. Girsa comes back, queen is ready to talk to us.

We walk up the stairs, up to a platform with a dais, covered in silvered orc skulls. Queen Brunhilde Battlehammer. Looks sad. Dwarves were mutinous when queen said dwarves shouldn't explore this new metal. Dwarven king got enthused by this metal when local blacksmith found it.

I convince the queen to take us to her husband, the mad king, to let us take a look at his situation. We restrain the king. Metal shard in his side. I know of mindflayer magic that can turn dwarves mad, turn them into derro.

Talk to Bailon the Beardless, leader from the enclave. Bald and dark skinned. We agreed to come with him tomorrow to visit the enclave, look around and see where

We rest up next to the king's room, hear him talking gibberish. Aedan hears him mutter stuff in deep speech.

- The red star made me do it
- Gorom is talking again
- All praise crenshinibon

Santiago mentions Rotom is followed by 3 spirits, one of them is Marlon, one is Sephak's and another human.

We follow Bailon deeper into the mountain, towards Deep Delver's Enclave. Suddenly boulders fall behind us, two arrows hit Bailon. Santiago sees duergar behind us. We fight three duergar, while the three others battle some others down the tight cavern.

Gem inside Hammerer armor, spell gem. Orange piece of quartz. Gem can contain a single spell you can cast immediately, even spells that take longer to cast. Mention this to party.
