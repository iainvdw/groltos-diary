# Session 10

**20 and 21 Nightal - Termalaine**

Before we set out for the Dwarven Valley, we stayed for a couple of days in [[Termalaine]] to rest and prepare for our journey eastwards. As we head a couple of days, I figured that I would attempt at making some oil of etherealness out of the vial of ectoplasm I managed to harvest from the ghost in the mine. It took me the better part of a day, but I managed to make the potion. It should come in handy when one of us wants or needs to traverse the Ethereal plane.

Figured the owlbear feathers would make a nice pillow for [[Kesni]], so I set out to find someone in town who could make a pillow from them. I gave the pillow to Kesni as a present when I told her I would be leaving again for a while. She was sad that I was leaving again, but was very happy to have gotten the very comfortable pillow. As much as I want to be around more often for her, I just can't. It's not safe enough here yet and I feel we've barely uncovered what's going on around this place. There's people looking for us, can't have them barging in on Kesni, or even Oarus for that matter.

**22 Nightal - Termalaine**

We set out for the Dwarven Valley.

====================

Earthquake. Avalanche. 

Three spikes from the ground. Malleable metal, similar to shard in Rotom's possession.

Dwarves on goats arrive. We tell them we're on official business from Termalaine. Takes a bit of convincing to tell the female dwarven captain, Girsa Splintersword.

We travel with the dwarves to their settlement, Battlehammer Hold. Great stone door. We enter hallway, quite empty. Santiago asks about the scarcity of dwarves in the settlement. Dwarves pushed into the mountain to mine the metal, emptying the hold up top. Queen didn't want the settlement to be emptied for the mining.

The captain takes us to a tavern, Dumathoins Ale. I talk to the bartender, asking about the empty halls. Queen didn't want the dwarves to mine because of the king going mad because of the metal. Rumours of a couple of dwarves going mad as well, but the bartender didn't know anyone himself. Girsa comes back, queen is ready to talk to us.

We walk up the stairs, up to a platform with a dais, covered in silvered orc skulls. Queen Brunhilde Battlehammer. Looks sad. Dwarves were mutinous when queen said dwarves shouldn't explore this new metal. Dwarven king got enthused by this metal when local blacksmith found it.

I convince the queen to take us to her husband, the mad king, to let us take a look at his situation. We restrain the king. Metal shard in his side. I know of mindflayer magic that can turn dwarves mad, turn them into derro.

Talk to Bailon the Beardless, leader from the enclave. Bald and dark skinned. We agreed to come with him tomorrow to visit the enclave, look around and see where

We rest up next to the king's room, hear him talking gibberish. Aedan hears him mutter stuff in deep speech.

- The red star made me do it
- Gorom is talking again
- All praise crenshinibon

Santiago mentions Rotom is followed by 3 spirits, one of them is Marlon, one is Sephak's and another human.

We follow Bailon deeper into the mountain, towards Deep Delver's Enclave. Suddenly boulders fall behind us, ambush. Two arrows hit Bailon. Santiago sees duergar behind us. We fight three duergar, while the three others battle some others down the tight cavern. After we dispatch the three behind us, we run down the tunnel to help the others. There were three more duergar. One like we saw behind us, one in mechanized armor and there supposedly was another hidden one.

Gem inside Hammerer armor, spell gem. Orange piece of quartz. Gem can contain a single spell you can cast immediately, even spells that take longer to cast. Mention this to party.
