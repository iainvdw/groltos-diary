# Session 10

**20 Nightal - Termalaine**

Before we set out for the Dwarven Valley, we stayed for a couple of days in [[Termalaine]] to rest and prepare for our journey eastwards. As we head a couple of days, I figured that I would attempt at making some oil of etherealness out of the vial of ectoplasm I managed to harvest from the ghost in the mine. It took me the better part of a day, but I managed to make the potion. It should come in handy when one of us wants or needs to traverse the Ethereal plane.

Figured the owlbear feathers would make a nice pillow for [[Kesni]], so I set out to find someone in town who could make a pillow from them. I gave the pillow to Kesni as a present when I told her I would be leaving again for a while in a couple of days. She was sad that I was leaving again, but was very happy to have gotten the very comfortable pillow. As much as I want to be around more often for her, I just can't. It's not safe enough here yet and I feel we've barely uncovered what's going on around this place. There's people looking for us, can't have them barging in on Kesni, or even Oarus for that matter.

**21 Nightal - Termalaine**
We talked to Oarus to prepare for our negotiations with the dwarves. Oarus gave us a bag of gems that we could show the dwarves as a sign of goodwill. Also, Amala would come along as a liaison of Termalaine who could work out the negotiations with the dwarves. 

**22 Nightal - Termalaine**

We started prepping for our journey. Oarus had a sled available that we could use as a transport. We set out for the Dwarven Valley under a dark, colourless sky. There was a bit of snowfall when we left, but that would pick up to heavier snow as we went eastwards. We decided to take the shorter route through the hills instead instead of taking the roads south, east and then north again. The terrain was a bit tougher to handle, but we managed quite fine. Until Aidan seemed to notice something. 

Aidan got down on one knee to feel the ground and listen. As soon as I wanted to ask what he noticed, we all heard something too. A deep rumble, that kept getting louder and louder. As soon as we knew what it would be, we were too late. [[Aust Rime|Aust]] shouted "Avalanche!" and started running for a hillock that looked like it would be able to give us some shelter from the wall of snow that was about to bury us all. Santiago, Rotom and I made it to the hillock and brace ourselves for what was coming. Amala tripped while running over here and Aidan and Aust helped her get her up on her feet again, but it was too late. The rumble turned into a loud roaring as the snow covered us all, turning everything white and then black as we got dragged along the hillside and covered under a thick layer of snow.

Gasping for air I started digging my way out of the snow. It took me a short while, but I managed to free myself. As I looked around, no one other than myself was there. About 100 feet down the hill, I suddenly see a lit torch. I start shouting towards it, but my shouting goes unanswered, overshadowed by strong wind. Tried lighting a torch as well, but I gave up as it wouldn't light in these conditions.

Then I see a glow coming from beneath me, two figures light up in the snow. As I thought that they must be two of my companions, I frantically start digging in the snow. I have nothing else to dig with than my bare hands, so I couldn't move as much snow as I would like. Then I feel something, it's a hand. An orcish hand, this must be Santiago! Pulled him out of the snow and the two of us start digging for Rotom as well. Rotom was

====================

Earthquake. Avalanche. 

Three spikes from the ground. Malleable metal, similar to shard in Rotom's possession.

Dwarves on goats arrive. We tell them we're on official business from Termalaine. Takes a bit of convincing to tell the female dwarven captain, Girsa Splintersword.

We travel with the dwarves to their settlement, Battlehammer Hold. Great stone door. We enter hallway, quite empty. Santiago asks about the scarcity of dwarves in the settlement. Dwarves pushed into the mountain to mine the metal, emptying the hold up top. Queen didn't want the settlement to be emptied for the mining.

The captain takes us to a tavern, Dumathoins Ale. I talk to the bartender, asking about the empty halls. Queen didn't want the dwarves to mine because of the king going mad because of the metal. Rumours of a couple of dwarves going mad as well, but the bartender didn't know anyone himself. Girsa comes back, queen is ready to talk to us.

We walk up the stairs, up to a platform with a dais, covered in silvered orc skulls. Queen Brunhilde Battlehammer. Looks sad. Dwarves were mutinous when queen said dwarves shouldn't explore this new metal. Dwarven king got enthused by this metal when local blacksmith found it.

I convince the queen to take us to her husband, the mad king, to let us take a look at his situation. We restrain the king. Metal shard in his side. I know of mindflayer magic that can turn dwarves mad, turn them into derro.

Talk to Bailon the Beardless, leader from the enclave. Bald and dark skinned. We agreed to come with him tomorrow to visit the enclave, look around and see where

We rest up next to the king's room, hear him talking gibberish. Aedan hears him mutter stuff in deep speech.

- The red star made me do it
- Gorom is talking again
- All praise crenshinibon

Santiago mentions Rotom is followed by 3 spirits, one of them is Marlon, one is Sephak's and another human.

We follow Bailon deeper into the mountain, towards Deep Delver's Enclave. Suddenly boulders fall behind us, ambush. Two arrows hit Bailon. Santiago sees duergar behind us. We fight three duergar, while the three others battle some others down the tight cavern. After we dispatch the three behind us, we run down the tunnel to help the others. There were three more duergar. One like we saw behind us, one in mechanized armor and there supposedly was another hidden one.

Gem inside Hammerer armor, spell gem. Orange piece of quartz. Gem can contain a single spell you can cast immediately, even spells that take longer to cast. Mention this to party.
