# Like moths to a fucking flame
**Questionable questioning**
We stood there, in the town hall. Amala held what remained of Ecko's head up by his hair and cast a spell. The decapitated remains of Ecko seemed to animate back to life again, as its eyes and mouth started to move. Amala stood there, looking at us start asking it the five questions granted to us. At first it didn't feel right, but I've seen far worse happen to dead people during my training. Inquisitive as I am, I took the lead in asking the questions to Ecko.

Asking what happened to him, he mentioned that he was standing at his desk when four figures walked in. Ecko didn't quite notice where they came from as he was just working at his desk and only saw them when they entered the town hall. Immediately they started an argument and eventually a dwarven woman of them hit him in the jaw, which slammed him to the ground and knocked him out. There was another woman, an elf in a black cloak who had a face which was half covered in ice. Two others were in full winter's clothes and had their faces covered up, so Ecko couldn't identify them. When Ecko regained consciousness shortly after being hit, he heard an argument coming from the cells. They were asking Torrga if she knew where the lantern was, but she didn't know. The answer was followed with a loud bang, and it went silent immediately after. Things got dark then for Ecko, as someone then cast a spell on him which made him turn into a zombie.

A lot happened today and there was a lot to take in... We went back to [[Speaker Oarus|Oarus']] house to get some rest after this exhausting day. With the recent events, we figured we might need to take turns in keeping watch. I took the first watch to keep us safe and warn the rest of any danger.

**A night to dream of**
The night started off quiet, aside from the howling wind outside. We're lucky to be inside now. Looking outside, I saw the aurora in the sky, stared at it for a while. Taking in its nefarious beauty. I was wondering what caused this phenomenon, when suddenly Yerthid started talking to me. She warned me of a presence near.

Walking to the others, I saw that everybody was sound asleep, apart from Rotom. She was twisting and turning. Quietly walking up to her to check if she was alright, I started to feel a chilling presence. The air suddenly grew cold when I got closer to her. Yerthid mentioned that the presence was here. Is something haunting Rotom perhaps?

Rotom woke up scared, big eyes looking straight at me. I guess I startled her as well, looming over her as she woke up from a nightmare. When I asked if she was alright, she mentioned that she had a strange dream, that it felt real. Rotom told me what she remembered from the dream. She stood in a glass or mirror like room, when a male voice spoke to her. The asked Rotom if she came to save it from the Ninth Tower until eventually the floor collapsed underneath her and then she woke up. 

Rotom suddenly grabbed something on her hip, a ring of keys. She said they felt freezing cold and dropped them on the floor. I picked them up to inspect them and indeed the keys were really cold to the touch. It was a set of nine keys made from shining moonstone, which look like they would fit an intricately complex lock. Rotom said she took them from a lady she traveled with on the way to Ten Towns. There was no particular reason why she took them, apart from that they were shiny. The lady belonged to a group called the Arcane Brotherhood. Rotom was there together with a pack of kobolds. When the other kobolds noticed her sticky fingers, she was cast out of the kobold clan. Seems like this ring of keys is keeping something important, or dangerous, locked away. I asked her if it was okay to have someone take a look at the keys some time, promising her that she would be able to keep them. Hesitant at first, she seemed to agree with the idea. I told her to keep these keys very close to her.

Seeing she was a bit calmer now, I told her it was best to go to sleep again. My watch was coming to an end as well so I woke up Santiago for his turn of the watch. I walked up to Kesni and tucked her in a bit. She was sound asleep, unaware of what had just happened. Got in my bed and went to sleep.

In my sleep I had a dream as well. There was this figure in a white cloak, had a blood soaked grinning face. "Like moths to a fucking flame", it said to me. Then a sharp pain on my head woke me up. I got hit by something, hard. In a reflex I immediately grabbed my crossbow and shot towards the figure looming over me. Unfortunately, I missed. It was Aust, his axe in his hand. He hit me with the blunt end when the moth landed on my head. "And, did I get it?", he asked. Confused as to what he was referring to, I saw him take another swing as he spotted the thing he was chasing after. It was a white moth that landed on the floor. Its wings divided by a bloody splat, it quickly started disintegrating into a small pile of dust before we could even take a look at it. "It was undead", Aust said. Aust and I got in a small argument about using his axe on my head. What was he thinking? Was he even thinking? Who knows...

Aside from this moth incident, the rest of the night went relatively smooth. When we woke up in the morning, we had breakfast and made plans for what to do next. There's a couple of leads we have, and Santiago started making a list of people we should investigate. We discussed Ravisin, Pippa and Nearth, and Henrack, among others. We decided to investigate the leads we have on Ravisin, the half-elven druid that visited Amala, as we had the clearest leads and location for her.

We checked our supplies and set out towards the woods, to see if we could find the druid circle only people of elvish descent could find. Aust was helming the expedition as he knew the area and because he is an elf himself.

================================

**On the way to Lonelywood**
Got lost in the woods. Moose tracks.

Ambushed by two owlbears. One fled, other killed. Harvested feathers.

Aust found a runed monolith, pointing out that the way to the Ward of Mallieki is revealed in during moonlight.

Found more moose tracks. Yerthid points out a dead figure against a tree, abdomen eaten away, eyes and mouth filled with snow. Wooden ring with rough amber, Lonelywood Logging Company. Asking Yerthid about the situation, she revealed a thick fog coming towards us. 

Walking into the mist, barren trees, red sheen from the sky. Man white cloak, dipped in red. "The spirit of the ancients, like moths to a fucking flame." Asked about these spirits, he told me that they were attracted to certain artifacts. Thinking about this, I pulled out my lantern, then my locket, but it seems he didn't mean material things. Lifting his head,  there was a bright red sheen from his face, elven face, white hair, dark skin. This was a drow. A powerful mage. I recognized the figure as the necromancer that took Yerthid! Fired crossbow bolt, sidestepped it. Figure said "Until we meet again mister Granitemuncher". Fired another crossbow bolt which hit, but ricocheted off by magic. The mist subsided. Regrouped. Told the group the story about my wife. They offered help.

Santiago cast Detect Magic:
- Marlon's metal shard: glowing red, Transmutation
- Rotom's keys: Necromancy
- Grolto's locket: Necromancy
- Kitty:

Aust led the way, found six statues of elven figures. I recognized one of them as the drow necromancer!
