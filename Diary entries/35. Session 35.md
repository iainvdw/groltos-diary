# Session 35
Rotom and Vellynne talk about the stolen keys and think Avarice and her following stole them. We run back towards Avarice's group, but as soon as we get to the broken walls of the fallen tower, we notice a large group of barbarians with weapons drawn walking through the caves. I call out to them to ask what they are doing here, and they respond with aggression. In response I grab hold of my silver amulet, and invoke the empowering blood ritual to strengthen and enlarge my form. I reach for my hand crossbow and fire twice at the first barbarian I see. The first crossbow bolt immediately drops the barbarian and the second one flies into the one behind.

Santiago runs towards Avarice and notices another group of barbarians. He casts a spell to hypnotize the group and catches a few of them. The leader of that group runs up to Santiago, reciting a prayer to The Frostmaiden.

On the opposite of the fallen tower, I see a tortle  the cave in search of them. Hearing the noise coming from the fallen tower, they peek in and see the enemy Tiger tribe barbarians. They throw a javelin through a hole in the wall on the other side. Climbing through the hole, grabbing their greataxe and splitting the barbarian's skull.

Rotom moves towards Santiago

Two barbarians run to me and attack.

Rime attacks the two barbarians, dropping one.

Aedan fires a volley of arrows to the last barbarian, dropping that one.

Knowing Santiago, I run to towards him and check on him. I see Santiago engaged in combat with two barbarians, one of them wearing a large sabretooth tiger skin over their head, two sabretooths poking out from their shoulders. This one looks like the leader of the barbarians, so I decide to fire my crossbow at them, firing four crossbow bolts.

The barbarian leader attacks me with their greataxe, greatly injuring me as I take two massive slashes that freeze my skin.

Someone casts moonbeam between Rotom and me.
