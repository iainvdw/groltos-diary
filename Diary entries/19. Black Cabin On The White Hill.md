# Black Cabin On The White Hill

**1 Deep Winter - Battlehammar Hold**

We were about to leave [[Battlehammar Hold]] after the undead raid on [[Deep Delver's Enclave]], having been rewarded for our aid in the battle. We talked among ourselves to decide on our next course of action. There were still some leads we had to go after around [[Lonelywood]], find [[Nass Lantomir]] and go after the [[Frozen Roses]], so we decided to head there.

There was a vendor selling giant goats in the market hall just inside of the massive stone gate. Figuring traveling through the raging blizzards would often be hard and slow, we bought ourselves some mounts. These beasts are massive and my short legs aren't really made for riding on these, but with a few adjustments to the saddle I managed to get myself seated properly and was ready to venture towards our next adventure.

Traveling down the frozen mountainside in the direction of [[Termalaine]] and [[Lonelywood]], we traveled past the border of what you could call civilization here and traveled north beyond Lonelywood, in search of [[Nass Lantomir]]'s cabin. It took us a short while, but managed to get there in a reasonable time as [[Aust Rime|Aust]] heard about this place before.

Eventually it popped up through the snow and there we saw the cabin. It was a black cabin standing on large poles above the snow, built on the edge of a cliff. The cabin looked very old, abandoned and was in a general state of disrepair. A set of stairs led up to a walkway leading past a few doors and windows. To the south there stood an outhouse and a pile of firewood.

Aust went up the stairs to inspect the house, where he reached a door just around the corner of the wooden walkway. Opening the door, Aust find some kind of workshop which was almost empty apart from a table and a bookcase. Continuing along the wooden walkway, Aust passes a few windows and then reaches a broken piece of the walkway. 

The others were inspecting the surroundings. Aedan find a pile of notes thrown down the hole in the outhouse, showing discarded plans for some kind of mechanism. Santiago and Rotom scouted to the north edge of the cabin but found nothing of interest.

On the walkway, Aust tried to cross the gap in the walkway by jumping to the other side. However, the walkway gave way under his weight and collapsed, causing Aust to drop onto the snowy cliff below the house. He almost rolled over the edge of the cliff, but managed to brace himself in the snow, preventing him from falling to his demise. I ran to his help, getting him back up from the snow, and we went upstairs again together.

Carefully crossing the gap in the walkway together, we reach the front door to the cabin. Carefully opening it and peeking inside, we see the room is wrecked. There are holes in the floor, the furniture is broken and charred and the windows have shattered. In the middle of the room, there's a wreck of a table, its surface burnt heavily. Beside the table, we find a burnt skeleton holding a strange device. Aust and I figure that we should clear the rooms to see if anyone's here.

The first room we check is a small storage room, containing some ruined wine barrels, frozen and broken, their contents long expired. The second room is a bit large, seems to have been a study of some sort. Two empty bookcases stand alongside the walls, paper is strewn across the floor. All of a sudden, one of the papers begins to move, jittering across the floor towards a corner. Kneeling down to look under the paper, I find a white ferret looking at both of us with large, frightened eyes. Tried luring it with some rations, but it hisses at me and skitters away. Aust also attempts at calming the animal by casting a spell and talking to it. After a few minutes, Aust learns that this white ferret is Nass Lantomir's familiar. If the skeleton in the main room is Nass', how is this familiar still here?

Behind us we suddenly hear something humming louder and louder, until there is a massive flash of light and heat, as Santiago screams shortly and drops to the floor. Running out of the room, we see Santiago's singed and smoking body, the strange device lying beside him. Aust and Aedan heal him and get him back up to his feet. Santiago tells us that he picked up the device when it started to flow and erupt in this massive burst of light.

Santiago sits on the floor for a while to recover, and then spots a medallion beside him, lying next to the corpse. He picks it up and studies it for a moment, when we all suddenly see the corpse ashes write a few words on the floor: "That is mine".

We learn that the entity writing in the ashes is Nass Lantomir's spirit, still haunting this cabin as she still has something to f

=====================================================

We heal Santiago, said he touched device. Santiago takes up a medallion, ashes start to skitter and write "That's mine".

Look at notes, think she's mistaken about the amount of energy flowing through the chardalyn infused rock. The rings contain the energy flowing through the rock. Rings made of iron, engraved with runes. Nass tells us the device needs a third ring and that its magic should have faded by now. Device is called the Summer Star, a small mythallar.

Aedan asks about the orb, which is apparently called Professor. Contains knowledge on:

1.  The history of Netheril and how to create a mythallar
2.  Vampirism and the traits of vampires 
3.  Rituals surrounding the making, bottling, and drinking of Elverquisst 
4.  The tarrasque

We go take a rest. Aust and Aedan rest inside the cabin and get a fire started in the hearth. Rotom and I join Santiago in the more comfortable protective dome.

As Santiago takes his watch. At the end of his watch when he was about to wake me, he spots bright moving lights coming from the forest up ahead, around 200ft away. I wake up [[Rotom Moonbane|Rotom]] and we head out to investigate. Santiago wakes Aust and Aedan and they coming running after us.

Rotom and I stop at a fallen tree, around 60ft away from the lights. At this moment we see that they're bodies covered in tattered clothing, shambling through the woods. A cold white light emanates from within. On two of them, I recognize the clothing of [[Ivahn of Daerlun|Ivahn]] and [[Gareth of Daerlun|Gareth]]. Around [[Ten Towns]] I've heard tales about these, victims of Auril sometimes turning into Cold Light Walkers.
