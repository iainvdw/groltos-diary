# The Siege of Deep Delver's Enclave

Position myself on the north tower with the ballista crew. Horde starts moving in. Lesser fodder starts to fall into hole that Santiago blew into the path winding up. I fire ballista at that large group, impaling three on one bolt.

Aedan points out that he sees a flying beast with many eyes floating above the horde. I shift my priority towards it and start firing at it. Recognizing the threat I invoke my rite of the dawn on the ballista, charging it with a glowing red glow. Together with the crew we load the ballista and fire at the beholder, barely missing it as it shifts its glide through the air, hitting a few zombies behind it.

Another shot at the beholder, misses again. Big boy is quite hard to hit.

Aedan takes a massive hit, dropping him to his knees for a moment. In response, he casts a spell causing the beholder to be bound to the ground

Finally hit him, taking a big chunk out of it.
