# The Siege of Deep Delver's Enclave

Position myself on the north tower with the ballista crew. Horde starts moving in. Lesser fodder starts to fall into hole that Santiago blew into the path winding up. I fire ballista at that large group, impaling three on one bolt.

Aedan points out that he sees a flying beast with many eyes floating above the horde. I shift my priority towards it and start firing at it. Recognizing the threat I invoke my rite of the dawn on the ballista, charging it with a glowing red glow. Together with the crew we load the ballista and fire at the beholder, barely missing it as it shifts its glide through the air, hitting a few zombies behind it.

Aedan hits it with his longbow, causing the beholder to rear in pain and shooting one of his rays at some of the zombies below it.

Another shot at the beholder, misses again. Big boy is quite hard to hit.

Zombies creeping up.

The beholder fires one of its rays at Aedan for a massive hit, causing him to drop to his knees screaming in pain for a moment.

Aedan casts a spell while he flees, causing the beholder to be bound down to the ground by some kind of webbing. Then Aedan vanishes immediately from sight.

Finally hit him, taking a big chunk out of it.

Zombies creeping up.

The beholder fires one of its rays at the outer gate, turning it to dust.

Bailon comes up running to the tower, asking if I've seen Aedan. I yell back that he's on the other tower.

I fire another time at the beholder that's down on the ground and miss again, as we're having a bit of trouble aiming it down that much.

Zombies creeping up.

Aedan reappears again near Bailon and Bailon hands him a scroll of Swift Quiver.

The beholder targets one of its rays towards the ballista crew, causing them to flee immediately. Having no help anymore loading and aiming the ballista, I reach for a grenade and throw it at the beholder and the zombies near it. The grenade lands next to the beholder and explodes in a huge fireball, taking out most of the zombies near it. The beholder seems to have survived the blast, although just barely. I climb down the tower towards the beholder, take out my hand crossbow and fire a shot straight through its eye, causing its head to split open in a slimy pile of rotten flesh.

Ogres throws two zombies towards the wooden palisades, one splatters against it, one makes it inside.

Aedan fires zombie inside wall and ogre couple times.

Loud screech from cavern west of me.

From the corner of my eye I see a massive shadow rise above the edge of the plateau, turning around and swooping down again.

Drop another grenade down the winding path on top of the zombies and ogre. Zombies explode and ogre takes a massive hit. I fire my hand crossbow at the ogre and hit it.

Aedan fires at ogre, pushing it over the edge of the path. Ogre tumbles all the way down and splits its skull open on a rock.

Behind us a familiar figure in a red cloak appears from the the Pit with the frozen waterfall.
