# The Siege of Deep Delver's Enclave
Seeing the horde of undead approach [[Deep Delver's Enclave]] and the panicked rushing of the townsfolk to prepare to hasty defenses, we all decide what to do. We're not entirely sure if we should ditch this place and head for safety, but we soon realise we have no way out, but through the horde. Shortly after some discussion, we decide to help out the dwarven town as they've also been pretty good to us.

Looking around town, we see two main entrances, north and west. [[Santiago Cruz de los Santos|Santiago]], [[Aedan]] and I head to the north gate to see how we can best defend ourselves. There's a double gate accompanied by two towers to the left and right manned with a ballista crew. Seems like Santiago has an idea, as he starts asking the dwarves closing the gates if there's a way to collapse the paths leading up to the northern and western gates. The dwarves seem to ignore Santiago and keep on preparing the defenses. I mention to Santiago that this is a mining town and they're bound to have some explosives we could use for that purpose.

I run towards the mining guild's building and barge through the door. Looking at us in surprise, the proprietor asks what my business is here. I start explaining the situation, that we're bound to be invaded by an undead horde and we want to slow them by blowing up the main paths. The proprietor is a bit hesitant, but after some arguments he starts to give in and hands me some crates of dynamite. At that point, Santiago also rushes in to help carry the crates. The proprietor gives him an untrusting look and asks if he isn't the one that's overflowed the market with a huge stockpile of chardalyn. Santiago dodges the question as he commands two dwarves to go collapse the western path, and pushes a crate of dynamite into their arms. The two dwarves look at each other confused, but then they take the crate and head to the western gate. Santiago and I carry what we can towards the northern gate.

The northern gate is almost closed, as Santiago rushes towards the dwarves, asking them to keep it open for just a little longer as he needs to go out and do something. The dwarves ask if he's crazy, but Santiago wouldn't be Santiago if he didn't manage to convince them. With the gate left with a small opening, Santiago rushes all the way down the path, towards the edge of [[Shadowreach]]. I climb up the tower to inspect and help prepare the defenses. 

From the tower, I can see Santiago charging like a mad bull down the path towards Shadowreach. At the bottom of the path, he places a number of sticks of dynamite on the floor and wall and lights them. Running back up the path again, a massive boom echoes through this underground cavern as we see the path cave in leaving a decent crater. That should slow the horde down somewhat. Halfway up the path, Santiago repeats the exercise again, blowing another crater in the path.

Suddenly, a loud voice echoes through the cavern, shouting at the inhabitants of the town. Looking in that direction, I see a flying figure in a red cloak above the horde, also bearing a red star. This figure seems to lead the invading horde, it asks the townsfolk to deliver the five criminals that stole the chardalyn and the town will be left alone. There's a sudden chill running down my spine as I suspect, no, _know_ that this leads to [[Santiago Cruz de los Santos|Santiago]] telling the merchants where to find the chardalyn. The noise of the defense preparations slowly subsides as everyone stops to look up and listen to this voice. Some are starting to look in my and Santiago's direction with a look on their faces that starts to worry me. There's some discussion and pointing fingers among the townsfolk for a moment that seemed to last forever. Will these dwarves turn their back on us after all we've done for them? Will they deliver us to this herald of the undead horde? Finally, we hear some protesting voices shouting back, that they'll never turn their back on friends. And the town springs back to life, continuing the defense preparations with even more determination.

In the meanwhile, I was trying to tie some sticks of dynamite to my crossbow bolts. Unsuccessfully so. Not entirely successful at this, I suddenly hear giggling behind me. Turning around, there stands [[Jayce Goldsmile]], curiously looking over my shoulder to see what I'm doing. She laughs a bit and tells me to come with her, as she's got something much better suited for this. I run after her towards her workshop, where she cautiously gets three metal balls out of a box filled with straw, and hands them to me. I better be really careful with these, as these grenades pack a massive punch. Very much more so than my failed attempt at explosive bolts. I thank Jayce very much, as this is going to be a massive help. Then I tell her to get to safety and join the rest of the townsfolk in the mining caverns deeper in the mountain, farthest away from the horde.

Running back north through town, I see weapons being handed out all who's able to fight. Some would barely be called adults, but these dwarves are fierce and determined. In the center of town, some dwarves are cooking up massive kettles of tar that would later be hoisted on the western towers. Rotom and Santiago have met up at a place the dwarves call The Pit. A hole in the middle of town, where a frozen river drops down into the valley of [[Shadowreach]]. I quickly stop at the armory to get some supplies and enough ammunition for my crossbow, before finally positioning myself on the west-most tower at the north gate. Looking down into Shadowreach, I can make out the shapes of the numerous undead starting to shuffle towards town. The invasion has begun...

Position myself on the north tower with the ballista crew. Horde starts moving in. Lesser fodder starts to fall into hole that Santiago blew into the path winding up. I fire ballista at that large group, impaling three on one bolt.

Aedan points out that he sees a flying beast with many eyes floating above the horde. I shift my priority towards it and start firing at it. Recognizing the threat I invoke my rite of the dawn on the ballista, charging it with a glowing red glow. Together with the crew we load the ballista and fire at the beholder, barely missing it as it shifts its glide through the air, hitting a few zombies behind it.

Aedan hits it with his longbow, causing the beholder to rear in pain and shooting one of his rays at some of the zombies below it.

Another shot at the beholder, misses again. Big boy is quite hard to hit.

Zombies creeping up.

The beholder fires one of its rays at Aedan for a massive hit, causing him to drop to his knees screaming in pain for a moment.

Aedan casts a spell while he flees, causing the beholder to be bound down to the ground by some kind of webbing. Then Aedan vanishes immediately from sight.

Finally hit him, taking a big chunk out of it.

Zombies creeping up.

The beholder fires one of its rays at the outer gate, turning it to dust.

Bailon comes up running to the tower, asking if I've seen Aedan. I yell back that he's on the other tower.

I fire another time at the beholder that's down on the ground and miss again, as we're having a bit of trouble aiming it down that much.

Zombies creeping up.

Aedan reappears again near Bailon and Bailon hands him a scroll of Swift Quiver.

The beholder targets one of its rays towards the ballista crew, causing them to flee immediately. Having no help anymore loading and aiming the ballista, I reach for a grenade and throw it at the beholder and the zombies near it. The grenade lands next to the beholder and explodes in a huge fireball, taking out most of the zombies near it. The beholder seems to have survived the blast, although just barely. I climb down the tower towards the beholder, take out my hand crossbow and fire a shot straight through its eye, causing its head to split open in a slimy pile of rotten flesh.

Ogres throws two zombies towards the wooden palisades, one splatters against it, one makes it inside.

Aedan fires zombie inside wall and ogre couple times.

Loud screech from cavern west of me.

From the corner of my eye I see a massive shadow rise above the edge of the plateau, turning around and swooping down again.

Drop another grenade down the winding path on top of the zombies and ogre. Zombies explode and ogre takes a massive hit. I fire my hand crossbow at the ogre and hit it.

Aedan fires at ogre, pushing it over the edge of the path. Ogre tumbles all the way down and splits its skull open on a rock.

Behind us a familiar figure in a red cloak appears from the the Pit with the frozen waterfall.
