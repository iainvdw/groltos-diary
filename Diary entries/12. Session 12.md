# Session 12
We talk to kobolds. One of them holds a pair of spectacles. Found them near a couple of grey dwarves, not using it. Rotom and Santiago convinced kobold to give them the pair, in exchange for a "magic stone with a hole in it, that can make you invisible". The kobold agrees.

Walking out of town hall, I see Rotom holding spectacles, seemed familiar as Jayce's spectacles. I convince Rotom to give the spectacles to Jayce, in return for something shiny, as she runs an artifact shop that might have some shiny things. She agrees.

We hand over the spectacles to Jayce. Rotom wants something in return. Jayce gives her invisibility powder.

We leave the shop and let the kobold take us to Shadowreach. We go through the northern gate and navigate the streets until we reach a spot where we can see traces of duergar having rested here. Tracks leading further into the city.

Walking into the city, we lose the tracks when the surroundings gradually change in ice and snow. We see a red glistening light in the snow. Investigating, we see a red glowing monolith surrounded by some boulders. There's a narrow tunnel leading into the mountain.

As Aedan and I near the monolith, we can see symbols on it: a red star. Also, we hear a humming noise in our minds when we come close. Aedan understands it as Deep Speech, repeating message:
"We are at risk of freezing. Send help. We crashed near a mountain chain."

Rotom gets mad, Santiago takes her away. Rotom says she heard loud beeping when she approached the monolith. I ask to take a look, Rotom reluctantly gets it out of her backpack, holding it tight so I can't grab it. Taking a look, I recognize it as a mindflayer tool they use to enhance their telepathic and communicate with the Elder Brain. We convince her to get rid of it, in exchange for more buttons and my steel mirror.

Rotom puts the purple gem on the ground and Aust smashes it with his axe.

I go exploring the tunnel, see a chamber and stairs. Report back to the group. We crawl through the narrow tunnel. Rotom and I get through fine, the other three are larger and get cut by some sharp pieces of chardalyn poking from the walls.

As we enter the room, I hear laughing coming from the stairs. Aust and I stand at the sides of the stairs to prepare an ambush, as Santiago suddenly starts shouting about finding his goat. Laughing stops, then continues. Santiago walks up the stairs, shouting more about the goat.

Suddenly, Santiago tumbles down, followed by some flasks containing a burning liquid: alchemist's fire.

Aust hands me the letters he found in the guard room. It's a list of ingredients and materials. At the top of the list, it says:

"Project Sunblight"
