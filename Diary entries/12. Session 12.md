# Session 12
We talk to kobolds. One of them holds a pair of spectacles. Rotom and Santiago convinced kobold to give them the pair

Walking out of town hall, I see Rotom holding spectacles, seemed familiar as Jayce's spectacles. I convince Rotom to give the spectacles to Jayce, in return for something.

We hand over the spectacles. Rotom wants something in return. Jayce gives her invisibility powder.

Kobold takes us to Shadowreach

Monolith, humming noise. Aedan understands it as Deep Speech, repeating message:
"We are at risk of freezing. Send help. We crashed near a mountain chain."
