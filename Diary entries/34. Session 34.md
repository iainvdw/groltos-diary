# Session 34
We stand in front of the blasted open waterfall and massive opening now stands tall before us, leading into the caverns.

Ceilings and walls are covered in webbing, looks natural. We find a crashed ship in an opening of the cavern.

I walk up to the ship and start inspecting it. Design work of crashed ship is beautiful, not familiar to me. Four bodies strapped in ship, skeletons now. All four are beheaded, 200 pound iron safe. [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]] and [[Avarice]] are geeking out of the crashed ship, believing it is a Netherese skycoach that was carrying the safe.

[[Aedan]] and [[Aust Rime|Rime]] explore the caverns a bit an walk into a narrow cavern. Rime notices a green glow in the cavern, and turning a corner sees two floating skulls wreathed in green flame inscribing the cavern wall in what seems like all kinds of calculations in a language none of us know. Rime walks up to the skulls and says "Boo". At that point, Aedan also turns the corner and fires two arrows at the skull.

As I hear Aedan and Rime starting a fight, I run over there and fire my imbued crossbow at it. The skulls reacts with a shield spell, but my second bolt flies through, shattering the skull as it clatters to the ground.

The second skull flies over to all three of us, and casts a fireball on itself.

Two more skulls show up near the ship from another room.

I call Vellynne over to inspect the runes on the wall. She pulls out the professor orb, to read the markings. Seems to be about this place, how fire affected this place, but not in they way we expect it would with ice.

Santiago inspects the other room, and finds more runes, and a few strange golden coins.

Rime moves ahead and finds a kobold with glowing red eyes and massive fangs sitting on a rock in the middle of the chamber. It hisses at Rime and bolts off.

Santiago and Rotom have jumped down into a larger room below, feather falling their way down for the short distance.

Aedan and I are with the the mages, who are looking at the safe. The markings on it are draconic, which seem to indicate numbers of the safe.
