# Session 29

Two frost giants on mammoths charge at us from the icy plane, the giants and mammoths look crazed, shouting at us.

I grow in size using my empowered blood.

Both charge at us, trying to trample Rime and me.

Frost giant has two large gauntlets, made of white dragon scale. We also take the mammoth tusks.
