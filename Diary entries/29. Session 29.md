# Session 29

Two frost giants on mammoths charge at us from the icy plane, the giants and mammoths look crazed, shouting at us.

I grow in size using my empowered blood.

Yerthid calls out to me. Something is off, there is a presence. Looking around the camp, I only notice that there is a slight red hue, with a baleful red star glowing in the sky. Yerthid tells me a presence is somewhere to the north. I sneak out and walk up the snowdrift.

Avarice in circle of red runes and candles, in some kind of ritual. Recognise some of the symbols, dealing with creatures from the Far Realm. I disturb Avarice's ritual to see what she is doing. She is communing with her deity. Asking what she was talking about, she doesn't immediately tell.

We need to be looking for large frozen over waterfall, near mouths of frozen over river.

Yerthid still notices a presence, same presence as with Omareth and the moths.

After half a days of travel, we see a metal structure appear through the blizzard, protruding from the snow.

Avarice says that she has been inside and cleared the first two levels. Rotom's keychain glows and shows an extra key. She finds a locked door and tries her new key on the door and the door opens.
