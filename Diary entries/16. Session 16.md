# Session 16

Dream, stone hall, columns precision cut black stone. Look into the face of the Gorom, stone giant.

**Omareth**
- Why is Omareth here? -> Crenshinibon, beacon
- What does he want? -> Revenge on a rival, one of the Netherese mages of Ythryn
- Where is he? -> Omareth lairs in Black Cathedral, fellow wizards of the Red Star created it. Monument to Crenshinibon.
- Where is his phylactery? -> The mountain is his phylactery

Aedan asks about his swarm. His ancients are not returning, they are trapped in the mountain. Gorom wants to show us what the moths are, asks us to follow him. We walk after Gorom. It starts snowing. Moths. We walk outside, it gets colder, actual snow and moths are now indistinguishable. Gorom gets a rod, sticks it in the ground, forms a protective bubble.

We see the three lakes of Icewind Dale, but no mountain. Floating city in the distance. Then an asteroid comes crashing down, massive explosion. Carves a valley in the ground and stops, forming the Dwarven Valley and Kelvin's Cairn.

We see creatures coming out of the mountain.

- Is Yerthid still alive? Is it truly Yerthid who's talking to me through my locket? Can she still be saved? If so, how and where?
- Where can we find Omareth? And how do we kill him?
- Who is Delban, for whom Omareth's a herald?
- What is happening to Icewind Dale? What's causing this endless winter? How do we return things to normal?
- Who is this Dark Duchess that Santiago spoke to in his sleep? Can Santiago be trusted? Why does he want to find this ship?
- Where do Rotom's moonstone keys lead? What do they unlock? What is this creature from the ninth tower? Why is it imprisoned? Is it safe to free it?
