# Session 26
**16 Deep Winter - Bryn Shander**

Rotom stands in front of the dwarf leading the procession, trying to stop them in their track and telling them to stop taking food from poor folk. The dwarf starts pulling his sword from his hilt, telling Rotom that he's had enough of her.

Seeing this, I ready my crossbow and yell at the dwarf that he should reconsider. Aedan stands beside me, nocking an arrow in his longbow. The dwarf doesn't comply and starts slashing at Rotom with a large ornate scimitar, which seems like an elven sword.

Santiago creates a magical wall of fire around the procession, instantly burning 4 acolytes.

Acolyte walks up to Santiago, wrapping his hands around his neck and casting a spell, causing Santiago's veins in his neck
