# Session 28
Aedan stands in the door towards Avarice's study, as she is questioning his identity with the question: "Aren't you a bit tall for Kadroth?". Aedan drops his spell and introduces us as he steps inside the room.

Avarice asks us what brings us to her and we explain our situation, that we want to find a path to [[Ythrin]]. She wants to go there too, and she asks for our reason to go there. We tell her that we want to find a mythallar there to stop the Endless Winter.

Mythallar ancient type of device, no one knows how the Netherese came up with it. Usually a crystal ball, quite large. Uses the excess power of the Weave to make the city of [[Ythrin]] float.

I show Avarice the lantern, she fetches a cylindrical device with a white lock from a room to the north. When she comes back with the device, Rotom's keys start to glow. She looks and there is a new key, glowing with blue energy. As Rotom moves closer to the device, the key solidifies more into an intricate decorated golden key. Avarice wants to take a look at the key, but it'll cost us. 250gp worth of incense, that she has, but we'll have to reimburse her. Rotom tries to cut a deal for 200gp, to which Avarice eventually agrees, if we'll do the expedition to [[Ythrin]] together.

She calls for a bird to find Kadroth and bring her the incense. Kadroth enters the mess hall from his study, sees the woman we tied under the table inside the silence bubble, sighs visibly but inaudibly, looks up and sees Santiago and Rime flipping him off. Kadroth brings in the incense and Avarice tells him off for not letting us see her.

With the incense, Avarice starts the ritual casting of Legend Lore, which would tell us more information about the history and workings of Rotom's keys. The ritual takes a while, most of us stay in the room to watch the ritual, but Santiago starts wandering about.

I look about the room, looking for some notes. She wants to nail chardalyn into the ice with the device she brought in the middle. The device is a "discharge cylinder", and I can gather from the notes that this device has the power of about a thousand magical missile spells, so this could be used as a kind of bomb. She probably wants to use this to blast through the ice to reach the titan frozen below the ice.

Santiago eventually turns up in the hallway pushing around a dwarven on a rocking chair, and starts shouting that she does not want to be taken back to Zardaroch Sunblight, because he is insane. Dragging the rocking chair down, towards the mess hall. She introduces herself as Hethyl and tells us she was to intend to marry Zardaroch Sunblight but does not wish to do so anymore. Zardaroch has a fortress, in the Spine of the World. That one is the father of [[Nildar Sunblight]] and a brother, Durth Sunblight. Zardaroch wishes to rule over Icewind Dale and intends to do so using a dragon they're building. Hethyl reveals that he is building the dragon in his fortress.

Upstairs, Rotom and Rime see Avarice is starting to prepare an expedition by packing stuff in bags.
