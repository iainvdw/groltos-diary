# Session 28
Aedan stands in the door towards Avarice's study, as she is questioning his identity with the question: "Aren't you a bit tall for Kadroth?". Aedan drops his spell and introduces us as he steps inside the room.

Avarice asks us what brings us to her and we explain our situation, that we want to find a path to [[Ythrin]].

Mythallar ancient type of device, no one knows how the Netherese came up with it. Usually a crystal ball, quite large. Uses the excess power of the Weave to make the city of [[Ythrin]] float.

I show Avarice the lantern, she fetches a cylindrical device with a white lock from a room to the north. When she comes back with the device, Rotom's keys start to glow. She looks and there is a new key, glowing with blue energy. As Rotom moves closer to the device, the key solidifies more into an intricate decorated golden key. Avarice wants to take a look at the key, but it'll cost us. 250gp worth of incense, that she has, but we'll have to reimburse her. Rotom tries to cut a deal for 200gp, to which Avarice eventually agrees, if we'll do the expedition to [[Ythrin]] together.

She calls for a bird to find Kadroth and bring her the incense. Kadroth enters the mess hall from his study, sees the woman we tied under the table inside the silence bubble, sighs visibly but inaudibly, looks up and sees Santiago and Rime flipping him off. Kadroth brings in the incense and Avarice tells him off for not letting us see her.

With the incense, Avarice starts the ritual casting of Legend Lore, which would tell us more information about the history and workings
