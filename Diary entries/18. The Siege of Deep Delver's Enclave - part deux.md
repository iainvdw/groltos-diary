# The Siege of Deep Delver's Enclave - part deux

I climb back up the tower to get a vantage point again, see my surroundings.

Bailon shatters the inner portcullis with a spell, his eyes glowing red.

Get hit by a massive black blast from the Mastermind, pinning me to the wall with slimy tentacles.

I shout out at Aedan and Bailon for help, manage to free myself and hide in the tower.

Aedan fires a volley of arrows at the Mastermind, causing it to lose control of Bailon.

Bailon throws a handful of pebbles at the Mastermind, casting a spell causing it to frantically count the pebbles for a moment.

I run up to Bailon, asking him if he has a healing potion. He tilts his head backwards towards his belt, where I see two flasks. I take one and drink it.

Aedan launches another volley at the Mastermind, severely wounding it.

The Mastermind casts a spell in Aedan's direction. Looking back, I can now see Aedan's eyes glowing red. It probably has control of Aedan. It also starts to go down the pit again.

I run out towards a ruin, get out my hand crossbow and start firing bolts at it. At the first hit, I notice it's lost its concentration on the spell it cast on Aedan.
