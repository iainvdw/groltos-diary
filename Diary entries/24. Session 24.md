# Session 24
**3 Hammer - Dark Duchess**

We all look at each other, scared shitless by this loud billowing voice speaking to us from on top of the ship. We can see this white scaled dragon head peering into the bowels of the ship, noticing our protective dome. It sniffs and scratches at the dome, then it tells us that it can smell us and hear our panicked heartbeats. The massive maw opens, trying to bite the bubble. The teeth screech against the outside as its unable to pierce though.

The dragon leaves us along for a bit, but we can still hear it stomping outside for a while, pacing around the ship. Possibly contemplating its next move. We discuss among ourselves to plan our way out of this. We lay out all the options on the table, all the magic we know, the weapons and gear we have with us. Finally, we cobble together something that resembles a plan, but we're going to need all the luck in the world to pull this off and get out alive.

First thing we had to do was to get some rest, as it had been a long day travelling here and dealing with the troll on the ship. Also, we needed all our strength to get this done, and we still had a couple of hours left on the dome to protect us from any harm while we try to do so.

**4 Hammer - Dark Duchess**

It was a rough night, as the dragon was still pacing outside. Scratching, pushing and pulling at the ship, seeing if there was a way to get to us. At some point, we though it had left when we didn't hear it for a short while anymore. But then, out of nowhere, we heard a loud splash coming from the sea. The ship then started to move, its wood creaking, as we figured the dragon was thumping the ice from beneath us, trying to break though to get to us.

[[Aust Rime|Aust]]'s part of the plan was up. Being an elf, he needs less rest than the rest of us, so he went ahead to prepare our escape. He begins writing a note mentioning the duergar constructing a metal dragon so they can defeat [[Arveiaturace]]. Then he starts melting enough ice to free all the treasure using a few cantrips.

Then as the rest of us woke up, we had to act fast as we only had limited time left on the protective dome. As we discussed in our plan, [[Santiago Cruz de los Santos, or Grok|Santiago]] casts a silencing spell to hide our actions from the dragon. When the spell is up, we start breaking through the ship's hull below us to reach the ice. Aust uses the same magic cantrip he used to melt the ice on the ice below us to try and create a tunnel, but its magic isn't potent enough to create a tunnel wide enough for us to fit through. It is wide enough to drop my last fire grenade in it, and as it tumbles down and we brace for the explosion, 

=============

The dragon is on top of us, sniffing at the bubble. Says it smells us, puts her giant teeth around the bubble, teeth screech against the bubble. We try to rest up as much as possible before we try to escape.

Aust wakes up first, preparing a distraction, trying to put the blame to the duergar, pointing out that they're building a chardalyn dragon to defeat [[Arveiaturace]]. Then Aust starts to melt as much as he can from the frozen dragon hoard.

As soon as Santiago wakes up, we discuss among ourselves what to do. We make a plan and set ourselves to it. Santiago casts Silence and we break through the hold. Fire bolt through the ice, drop down grenade. We drop down and leave Santiago. Aust makes a bubble under water with us four in it and 

Santiago teleports out of the ship as soon as we're clear of the ship.

We walk under water in the bubble tunnel and move south.
