# Session 27

I ask around for Avarice, [[Crannoc Siever]] stands up, speaker for [[Caer-Dineval]]. Mentions that he has been thrown out of his fortress. Avarice has a tiefling cult, worshiping devils. Wearing strange metal things around their neck, worshiping Levistus, a devil. The speaker is a zealous man, is a follower of Auril. Heard tales about Crannoc forcing people to sleep with their doors open to sacrifice heat. Avarice and tieflings showed up armed, threw him out.

[[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]] knows Avarice from the [[Arcane Brotherhood]], stops at nothing to get what she wants. Probably misled some people to gain favour with all of them, using her tiefling appearance. Vellynne walks over to Dzaan, asking him to write down the plans. Vellynne then casts Suggestion to make him write, and he does so.

Dzaan wants to use the lantern, to find a frozen leviathan in the Reghed glacier. Path to [[Ythrin]]. Dzaan asked to fetch a book from [[Grimskalle]], book need to open the jaws of the titan. Then walk to centre of [[Ythrin]].

We have three options to continue:
- Go to sea of moving ice to get to Grimskalle
- Avarice at Caer-Dineval
- Visit the spire in the ice with [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]]

Avarice is magic hungry, ever since they started researching [[Ythrin]] and the ancient Netherese civilisation. First time Vellynne hears that Avarice worships devils. Vellynne does say she is a very selfish person, but not truly evil.

Council moves on executing [[Dzaan]] as they believe he has shared what he knows now.

We find [[Crannoc Siever]], to ask about [[Avarice]]. Some of the tieflings have been walking around town carrying burlap sacks from the harbour back to the fortress. Didn't look smooth, looked like it contained crude objects, presumably something like metal.

Rime has a contact in [[Caer-Dineval]], [[Yselm Bloodfang]], an ex-tribe member from the Reghed glacier, leading expeditions on the glacier from there from a company called Frozen Far Expeditions.

Rime remembers a name from Caer-Dineval on the list in the [[Sunless Grove]], [[Kadroth]], and inquires with Crannoc. Crannoc tells us he is another tiefling from the cult, leading the cults day to day business.

We rest up for the night, pick up Santiago's whip and head out for Caer-Dineval. We enter Caer-Dineval from the west. We see a large looming fortress at the top of a tiny hamlet.

Rime takes us to Frozen Far Expeditions and knocks on the door. A hulking goliath woman, [[Yselm Bloodfang]], opens the door and invites us in. Rime asks about the speaker being kicked out from his fort. There are some tieflings hauling stuff from the harbour, they have been quite secluded. Rime asks about any duergar, no living duergar are in Caer-Dineval. Some dead corpses on the dock, she has no idea who killed them. She offers us some stew, which does not contained knucklehead trout, so that sounds very welcoming to all of us.

Ever since the tieflings moved in, things have calmed down a bit. No townsguard kicking open doors to let heat out and cold in.

We leave Vellynne at [[Yselm Bloodfang]] and we set out for the fortress. Santiago rushes up to the door and starts knocking and shouting that he wants to talk about some lord and savior. Guards peer from two latches, asking what's going on. Santiago and Rotom start shouting at the guard, that we want to enter. Rotom mentions she's the queen and is seeking shelter from the cold. Guards aren't convinced and shut the latches again.

At that point Santiago casts a spell, teleporting Rotom and him to within the walls.

[[Kadroth]] eventually shows up, allowing us to enter the courtyard.

We walk inside the fortress with Kadroth. A figure appears, an older looking woman, asking if we'd like a drink. We pass on the drinks. They are followers of the Lord of Stygia, who is trapped in ice in Stygia. The want to free him from this prison. I inquire a bit about this lord, but he's not letting loose much information.

Kadroth asks me about all of us, where we came from, why we are here, how we came by the lantern. I say that we've had the lantern for weeks, we heard the name of Avarice from Dzaan, mention that he's about the be executed for leading a group of young adventurers to their deaths. Kadroth mentions this being good news.

Outside, Rotom and Santiago are lurking around the courtyard, exploring the place. They've talked to the small boy who was standing near a shack and managed to convince him to tell them where the entrance to the cistern is, as well as a secret path into Crannoc's old office. Santiago managed to convince Melada to give them a tour around the fortress.

Kadroth tells us Levistus wants them to find Ythrin as well. Before At this point, Santiago, Rotom and Melada barge into the common room where we are talking. Following Melada upstairs, Rotom and Santiago are suddenly stopped by Kadroth by the same spell as earlier. A short back and forth erupts, and Kadroth announces that he is done with us.
