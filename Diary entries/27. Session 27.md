# Session 27

I ask around for Avarice, Crannoc Siever stands up. Mentions that he has been thrown out of his fortress. Avarice has a tiefling cult, worshiping devils. Wearing strange metal things around their neck, worshiping Levistus, a devil. The speaker is a zealous man, is a follower of Auril. Heard tales about Crannoc forcing people to sleep with their doors open to sacrifice heat. Avarice and tieflings showed up armed, threw him out.

Vellynne knows Avarice from the [[Arcane Brotherhood]], stops at nothing to get what she wants. Probably misled some people to gain favour with all of them, using her tiefling appearance. Vellynne walks over to Dzaan, asking him to write down the plans. Vellynne then casts Suggestion to make him write, and he does so.

Dzaan wants to use the lantern, to find a frozen leviathan in the Reghed glacier. Path to [[Ythrin]]. Dzaan asked to fetch a book from Grimskalle, book need to open the jaws of the titan. Then walk to centre of [[Ythrin]].
