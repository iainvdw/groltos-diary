# Session 27

I ask around for Avarice, [[Crannoc Siever]] stands up, speaker for [[Caer-Dineval]]. Mentions that he has been thrown out of his fortress. Avarice has a tiefling cult, worshiping devils. Wearing strange metal things around their neck, worshiping Levistus, a devil. The speaker is a zealous man, is a follower of Auril. Heard tales about Crannoc forcing people to sleep with their doors open to sacrifice heat. Avarice and tieflings showed up armed, threw him out.

[[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]] knows Avarice from the [[Arcane Brotherhood]], stops at nothing to get what she wants. Probably misled some people to gain favour with all of them, using her tiefling appearance. Vellynne walks over to Dzaan, asking him to write down the plans. Vellynne then casts Suggestion to make him write, and he does so.

Dzaan wants to use the lantern, to find a frozen leviathan in the Reghed glacier. Path to [[Ythrin]]. Dzaan asked to fetch a book from [[Grimskalle]], book need to open the jaws of the titan. Then walk to centre of [[Ythrin]].

We have three options to continue:
- Go to sea of moving ice to get to Grimskalle
- Avarice at Caer-Dineval
- Visit the spire in the ice with [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]]

Avarice is magic hungry, ever since they started researching [[Ythrin]] and the ancient Netherese civilisation. First time Vellynne hears that Avarice worships devils. Vellynne does say she is a very selfish person, but not truly evil.

Council moves on executing [[Dzaan]] as they believe he has shared what he knows now.

We find [[Crannoc Siever]], to ask about [[Avarice]]. Some of the tieflings have been walking around town carrying burlap sacks from the harbour back to the fortress. Didn't look smooth, looked like it contained crude objects, presumably something like metal.

Rime has a contact in [[Caer-Dineval]], [[Yselm Bloodfang]], an ex-tribe member from the Reghed glacier, leading expeditions on the glacier from there from a company called Frozen Far Expeditions.

Rime remembers a name from Caer-Dineval on the list in the [[Sunless Grove]], [[Kadroth]], and inquires with Crannoc. Crannoc tells us he is another tiefling from the cult, leading the cults day to day business.

We rest up for the night, pick up Santiago's whip and head out for Caer-Dineval. We enter Caer-Dineval from the west. We see a large looming fortress at the top of a tiny hamlet.

Rime takes us to Frozen Far Expeditions and knocks on the door. A hulking goliath woman, [[Yselm Bloodfang]], opens the door and invites us in. Rime asks about the speaker being kicked out from his fort. There are some tieflings hauling stuff from the harbour, they have been quite secluded. Rime asks about any duergar, no living duergar are in Caer-Dineval. Some dead corpses on the dock, she has no idea who killed them. She offers us some stew, which does not contained knucklehead trout, so that sounds very welcoming to all of us.

Ever since the tieflings moved in, things have calmed down a bit. No townsguard kicking open doors to let heat out and cold in.
