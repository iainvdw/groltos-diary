# Session 9
Wake up, penguin Kingsporth putting berries into our mouths.

Leads us into room of Ravisin, tomb containing sarcophagus moon symbol. Santiago pisses in Rav's boots.

Rotom lights moon symbols to open other door. Another tomb containing a sarcophagus. We open the sarcophagus. Elven mummy. Unstrung bow. Silver arrow heads. 

We loot the other sarcophagus as well, but it's empty.

We take the penguin outside to the tomb of Sahnar to see if he knows more about it.

We take a long rest.

Aeden arrives in the morning. I wake up and go outside and see his head poking through the hole in the wall.

We convince Aeden to help with the ritual of the tomb. We open the tomb, mummy of Sahnar arises. 

Aeden asks about his bees. Sahnar replies with "Crenshinibon is drawing in spirits. Inside the mountain a root is growing."

I ask about Omareth Baenre, the necromancer. He got more interested after the defeat of Dur-Baagal. Rules over the growing mountain and studying it.

We cremate Marlon on a pyre in the forest.

We go look into the mirror. Santiago sees a ship. It's the ship he wanted us to find. Went outside to show us the map and say we needed to go there immediately. I convinced Santiago that we will eventually get to his ship, but after we take care of Ravisin.

We walk back to Termalaine. Talked to Aeden about his white moths. He's a beekeeper from near Good Mead. His bees went missing and were "replaced" by moths. Told him about my encounter with the moths.

Informed Amala about the murder list in the grove.

Man, 30s, long black hair, goatee. Underneath winter's clothing a red robe. Name is Dzaan. Looked like a wizard. Was looking for Torrga, had a deal about the lantern. Mentioned Avarice, from the kill list, something about a bidding war. Needed the lantern for finding a certain titan. Dur-Baagal?

Rotom is looking at a metal shard, similar to the one Marlon found on the ghost in the mine. It's growing in size...
