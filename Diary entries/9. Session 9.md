# Session 9
Wake up, penguin Kingsporth putting berries into our mouths.

Leads us into room of Ravisin, tomb containing sarcophagus moon symbol. Santiago pisses in Rav's boots.

Rotom lights moon symbols to open other door. Another tomb containing a sarcophagus. We open the sarcophagus. Elven mummy. Unstrung bow. Silver arrow heads. 

We loot the other sarcophagus as well, but it's empty.
