# Session 9
Wake up, penguin Kingsporth putting berries into our mouths.

Leads us into room of Ravisin, tomb containing sarcophagus moon symbol. Santiago pisses in Rav's boots.

Rotom lights moon symbols to open other door. Another tomb containing a sarcophagus. We open the sarcophagus. Elven mummy. Unstrung bow. Silver arrow heads. 

We loot the other sarcophagus as well, but it's empty.

We take the penguin outside to the tomb of Sahnar to see if knows more about it.

We rest

Aeden arrives.

We convince Aeden to help with the ritual of the tomb. We open the tomb, mummy of Sahnar arises. 

Aeden asks about his bees. Sahnar replies with "Crenshinibon is growing. Inside the mountain a root is growing."

I ask about Omareth Baenre, the necromancer. He got more interested after the defeat of Dur-Baagal. Rules over the growing mountain.

We bury Marlon.

We go look into the mirror. Santiago sees a ship. It's the ship he wanted us to find. Went outside to show us the map and say we needed to go there immediately.
