# Session 9
The blackness faded from my vision, a weird taste in my mouth. Rotom and a weird bird were looking over me as I regained my consciousness. Looking over to the others, seems like everybody's slowly waking from our encounter with Ravisin. Everyone, but Marlon. Rotom and Aust try some desperate options, using healing kits and spells, to no avail.

Marlon had taken quite a beating in the battle with Henrack. And that last hit, the icy storm that ravaged the interior of the tomb's hallways, must have pushed him over the edge. Another murder on the hands of Henrack and Ravisin...

The penguin introduced himself as Kingsporth, apparently a servant of Ravisin. He's one of the animals that she "blessed" with intelligence and speech. Seeing the four of us lying unconscious had him bring a silver platter with some goodberries to bring us back to consciousness.

We started interrogating the flightless fucker, asking about Ravisin and this place. He didn't seem to know much at all, but that didn't satisfy Santiago. At all. Grabbing the little flightless bird by its feathers, Santiago started shouting at Kingsporth for answers. To annoy the bird, Santiago started it Philip Knobsworth

=============================================

Penguin leads us into room of Ravisin, tomb containing sarcophagus moon symbol. Santiago pisses in Rav's boots.

Rotom lights moon symbols to open other door. Another tomb containing a sarcophagus. We open the sarcophagus. Elven mummy. Unstrung bow. Silver arrow heads. 

We loot the other sarcophagus as well, but it's empty.

We take the penguin outside to the tomb of Sahnar to see if he knows more about it.

We take a long rest.

Aeden arrives in the morning. I wake up and go outside and see his head poking through the hole in the wall.

We convince Aeden to help with the ritual of the tomb. We open the tomb, mummy of Sahnar arises. 

Aeden asks about his bees. Sahnar replies with "Crenshinibon is drawing in spirits. Inside the mountain a root is growing."

I ask about Omareth Baenre, the necromancer. He got more interested after the defeat of Dur-Baagal. Rules over the growing mountain and studying it.

We cremate Marlon on a pyre in the forest.

We go look into the mirror. Santiago sees a ship. It's the ship he wanted us to find. Went outside to show us the map and say we needed to go there immediately. I convinced Santiago that we will eventually get to his ship, but after we take care of Ravisin.

We walk back to Termalaine. Talked to Aeden about his white moths. He's a beekeeper from near Good Mead. His bees went missing and were "replaced" by moths. Told him about my encounter with the moths.

Informed Amala about the murder list in the grove.

Man, 30s, long black hair, goatee. Underneath winter's clothing a red robe. Name is Dzaan. Looked like a wizard. Was looking for Torrga, had a deal about the lantern. Mentioned a wizard named Avarice, also on the kill list, to be in a bidding war with him. Needed the lantern for finding a certain titan. Dur-Baagal?

Rotom is looking at a metal shard, similar to the one Marlon found on the ghost in the mine. It's growing in size...
