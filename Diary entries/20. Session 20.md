# Session 20

Thee Coldlight Walkers in front of us at the end of a clearing in the woods. 

Imbuing my light crossbow with my rite of the dawn, I fire two crossbow bolts at the leftmost walker. Light shoots from the holes left by the bolts.

Rotom runs up and throws a couple of daggers.

Walkers come walking towards us and fire beams of cold light straight at us but miss all of us.

Santiago hypnotic lights one left one and Rotom.

Aedan kills the left one with arrows.

Right one fires a ray of light at me, and hits me this time. 

Aust kills the middle one.

Right one fires a ray of light at me, and hits me this time, taking me out.

Aust and Aedan kill the right one.

Aedan heals me, waking me up. Walk back to Santiago's hut where it's warm. We finish the sleep and heal up. Santiago wakes me up as I'm apparently snoring but I tell him to fuck off and continue sleeping.

Santiago leaves the hut suddenly causing it to disappear. We all wake up and see someone approach on a dog sled. It's Vellynne Harpell.

We walk inside house.

Research on Dark Duchess. Iriolarthas, Netherese archmage, arch enemy of [[Omareth Baenre|Omareth]]. Red Star mages were no fans of Iriolarthas. Netheril mages led by Iriolarthas went on an expedition to research Crenshinibon in the mountain, when they bumped into Red Star mages in Shadowreach, causing a massive battle/war between the two factions.
