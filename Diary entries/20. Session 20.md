# Session 20

Thee Coldlight Walkers in front of us at the end of a clearing in the woods. 

Imbuing my light crossbow with my rite of the dawn, I fire two crossbow bolts at the leftmost walker. Light shoots from the holes left by the bolts.

Rotom runs up and throws a couple of daggers.

Walkers come walking towards us and fire beams of cold light straight at us but miss all of us.
