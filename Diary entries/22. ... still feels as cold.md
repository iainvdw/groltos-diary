# ... Still Feels As Cold

A screaming and shouting match ensues as the women of the [[Frozen Roses]] look in disgust at the two severed heads on the floor and [[Shalheira]]'s bloodied tunic. Shalheira addresses them in a speech, speaking with a loud and strong voice as their new leader. Telling the crowd that this was the best outcome for them, as we initially set out to permanently deal with the Frozen Roses. The mood of the crowd calms as she promises them that she made a deal with us and that we won't sell them out.

[[Aust Rime|Aust]] and [[Rotom Moonbane|Rotom]] join in on the speech, telling them all that we know of the sacrificial lotteries. When we mention that the lotteries are rigged, eyes widen and gasps of shock are heard among the women. The story of us saving [[Ivahn of Daerlun|Ivahn]] and [[Gareth of Daerlun|Gareth]], only leading to them still being killed, causes some angry looks of betrayal on the women's faces.

When Shalheira mentions that they want to establish better relations with Ten Towns to ensure a better future for them, it seems that most of them are now convinced that Adelia had to be taken out. More and more voices rise up in agreement, until eventually the women are cheering, toasting and chanting.

The mood eventually calms down a bit and the chatter, singing and laughing resumes as before. Aedan finds someone familiar, Tinna Rielsbarrow, a woman from [[Good Mead]] he knows as the sister of the speaker there. Tinna tells Aedan that that Good Mead is doing fine, but that she's worried about [[Dougan's Hole]]. The speaker there requires townsfolk to leave their door open to sacrifice the heat. Anyone who freezes to death is their sacrifice to [[Auril, The Frostmaiden|Auril]] for the time being.

Aedan also asks Tinna about the claw he found earlier. Tinna mentions that it is from a ghoul [[Shalheira]] sometimes summons to guard the hideout. It would have a chilling effect when it scratched someone. Shalheira would sometimes use ghouls as guards until she could find no use for them, letting the spell wear off, causing the ghouls to start wandering around.

Shalheira takes us further into their hideout where she rewards us with gold and treasure:

- 500 gold pieces
- 1 piece of Aquamarine, worth 500gp
- Large well-made tapestry depicting the settling of Ten Towns, worth 250gp
- Carved Ivory Statuette of an [[Axe beak]] from Chult, worth 200gp
- Golden ring with blood stones, worth 450gp
- Pair of engraved bone dice, worth 25gp
- 6 antique ivory buttons worth, worth 20gp
- A hunter's coat

From the corner of her eye, Shalheira then notices the horn attached to Rotom's crown, and asks it back. Of course Rotom wouldn't just do away with it, and in a sad voice tells Shalheira that she found it and wants to keep it, putting up the largest puppy eyes I've ever seen her do. Shalheira gives in and allows Rotom to keep it.

We ask Shalheira about the [[Creed of Auril]]. It is being led by druidic cult who believes Auril is acting out causing the endless winter. Their belief is that we need to show her more devotion and cruelty to keep her satisfied. We mention that we have met one of them, [[Ravisin]], and Shalheira mentions that Ravisin has also approached her to join her cause. Shalheira declined the offer, having no interest in their evil practices. 

The leadership of the Creed of Auril meet in a Frost Giant cave near the Sea of Moving Ice, called Grimskalle. Shalheira has only heard this info, she has never been before. There have been people who are able to commune with Auril, who tell a similar story. The Creed of Auril mainly consists of the awakened animals that they use for defense and spying, of which they apparently have a lot. As for the actual members of the cult, there are five frost druids and an ancient priestess as their leader, [[Anga Keos]].

Asking how the Frozen Roses will continue their existence, she asks us if we could provide them with any help. I mention being a friend with Oarus and that I can write a letter vouching for Shalheira and the Frozen Roses. To make sure Oarus would recognise the letter actually came from me, I mention a couple of personal things in the letter, like telling [[Kesni]] she will see me again soon.

As the day was ending, we thought it would be best to stay here for the night and take a couple of drinks in the tavern. Some sleep inside the hideout, while others sleep in the familiar comfort of Santiago's hut.

The next morning we regroup outside and set off towards the west on our goat mounts, in search of [[The Dark Duchess]] to look for the research [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]] is eagerly looking to get her hands on. We travel through the Lonelywood forest, heading west and crossing the river leading to Maer Dualdon, following its northern bank.

A few hours into our travel, we are quite a ways beyond the borders of [[Ten Towns]]. The landscape has turned from a wooded hilly terrain into a barren and frozen tundra, the icy wind blasting in our faces. Aust and Aedan lead the group, when their goats suddenly stumble over a pile of frozen heads sticking from the ground. We get off our goats for a moment to inspect, noticing that some of the heads have scratch marks. 

Aedan recognises what this is: a yeti hoard. Yetis tend to rip the heads off of their prey and store them somewhere as their treasure. When we hear this, we immediately look around if we spot any yetis in the vicinity, but all we found are three tracks leading away. Seems to be a yeti family, as the tracks have left two larger an one smaller pair of feet imprints in the snow.

I ask what we should do about these yetis, proposing that we find and kill them as these are dangerous monsters stalking the people of Ten Towns. The rest seems to disagree as they think they're too dangerous to handle. Slightly disappointed I get back onto my goat mount and we continue our journey west.

As the sky is starting to display a range of wavy bright colours, it appears the evening is setting in. Santiago finds a good spot to set up the magical hut again. We tie our goats to a nearby dead tree trunk and head inside the dome for a night's rest.

At the start of the night, Aust and I take a first watch. The snow starts to come down pretty heavy, covering the shelter quickly with a quick layer of snow, making it hard for us to see outside. During our watch, we hear soft sounds of snow crunching, then some sniffing near my head, just outside the dome. I can't see what's making these noises, as the dome has been fully covered by snow now. Carefully clearing some snow away from the inside, I spot two silver foxes, curiously investigating our hut.

Suddenly, the two foxes start speaking in Common! They mention not having seen this mound here before, wondering what it might be. When they start digging, we can hear their nails scratching the outside of the dome. I wake [[Aedan]], asking if we should do something with these foxes, but he thinks they're best left alone. 

At this point, Rotom wakes up from the muttering inside the hut, asking what's going on. Telling her that I spotted two silver foxes outside, her eyes light up as she says she's always wanted a pet fox! In a loud voice, she says "Hello!" from within the dome, causing the two foxes to jump up in a fright scare and skitter off. Looking outside again, we can't spot the foxes anymore and they're not 

=================

We almost trip over three frozen heads in the ground, some of them have scratch marks. Aedan thinks it's a yeti hoard. We don't see the yeti immediately, but we spot tracks in the snow.  We move away, deciding not to find and engage the yeti's.

The sky turns bright colours as it apparently turns to night. Santiago puts up the sleeping dome again. Aust and I take watch. It starts snowing pretty heavily, covering the dome in snow. Early in the night during my watch, i hear sniffing outside the dome. Carefully clearing some snow, I spot two silver foxes. Suddenly, they're talking in Common! They mention that they've not encountered this hillock before, wondering about it. They start digging and scratch the outside of the dome. I wake Aedan, asking if we should do something with these foxes. At this time, Rotom wakes up and asks what's going on. I tell about the silver foxes. Rotom wants to befriend them and says "hello" through the snow. The silver foxes jump up in a scare and run off. We don;t see them again. Aust leaves some food outside, but that's still there but the morning. 

We set out west again through the tundra. Eventually we see the terrain turn darker further out, which would be the Sea of Moving Ice. We camp out in the dome again. During Rime's watch, he spots large figures moving in the distance. Mammoths from the looks of it. A sudden sounding of a horn causes the group of mammoths to stampede in our direction. As they do, we see they're being hunted by a group of people in the distance.

A mammoth bull and bear are leading a pack of smaller mammoths out of the way of a group of orc hunters. First, we run out of the way. Aedan casts faerie fire to light us up to try and scare the mammoths away from us. Apparently it works, as the pack moves out of our direction. Bear mammoth gets stuck in ice. Santiago casts hypnotic pattern on the bear mammoth, mesmerizing it. The group of hunters starts targeting both a smaller mammoth and the bear. Santiago and Rotom also target the smaller mammoth. The bull notices this and turns around and tries defend his mate and child, but fails to do so. The bear and bull take off with the rest of the mammoths, leaving the heavily wounded child. The orc chief leading the hunters ends the suffering of the child mammoth with its sword.

We talk to the chief orc, who's happy to have managed to kill the smaller mammoth. Santiago and Rotom engage in conversation with the orcs and convince them to take us with them to feast on the successful mammoth hunt.
