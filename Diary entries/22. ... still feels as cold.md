# ... still feels as cold

A screaming and shouting match ensues as the women of the [[Frozen Roses]] look in disgust at the two severed heads on the floor and [[Shalheira]]'s bloodied tunic. Shalheira addresses them in a speech, speaking with a loud and strong voice as their new leader. Telling the crowd that this was the best outcome for them, as we initially set out to permanently deal with the Frozen Roses. The mood of the crowd calms as she promises them that she made a deal with us and that we won't sell them out.

[[Aust Rime|Aust]] and [[Rotom Moonbane|Rotom]] join in on the speech, telling them all that we know of the sacrificial lotteries. When we mention that the lotteries are rigged, eyes widen and gasps of shock are heard among the women. The story of us saving [[Ivahn of Daerlun|Ivahn]] and [[Gareth of Daerlun|Gareth]], only leading to them still being killed, causes some angry looks of betrayal on the women's faces.

When Shalheira mentions that they want to establish better relations with Ten Towns to ensure a better future for them, it seems that most of them are now convinced that Adelia had to be taken out. More and more voices rise up in agreement, until eventually the women are cheering, toasting and chanting.

Shalheira takes us further into their hideout where she rewards us with gold and treasure:

- 500 gold pieces
- 1 piece of Aquamarine, worth 500gp
- Large well-made tapestry depicting the settling of Ten Towns, worth 250gp
- Carved Ivory Statuette of an [[Axe beak]] from Chult, worth 200gp
- Golden ring with blood stones, worth 450gp
- Pair of engraved bone dice, worth 25gp
- 6 antique ivory buttons worth, worth 20gp
- A hunter's coat

From the corner of her eye, Shalheira then notices the horn attached to Rotom's crown, and asks it back. Of course Rotom wouldn't just do away with it, and in a sad voice tells Shalheira that she found it and wants to keep it, putting up the largest puppy eyes I've ever seen her do. Shalheira gives in and allows Rotom to keep it.

Asking how the Frozen Roses will continue their existence, she asks us if we could provide them with any help. I mention being a friend with Oarus and that I can write a letter vouching for Shalheira and the Frozen Roses. To make sure Oarus would recognise the letter actually came from me, I mention a couple of personal things in the letter, like telling [[Kesni]] she will see me again soon.

As the day was ending, we thought it would be best to stay here for the night and take a couple of drinks in the tavern. Some sleep inside the hideout, while others sleep in the familiar comfort of Santiago's hut.

The next morning we regroup outside and set off towards the west, in search of [[The Dark Duchess]] to look for the research [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]] is eagerly looking to get her hands on.

=========================

Shalheira takes us inside the Frozen Roses hideout, through the mammoth skull. She throws the two heads of [[Adelia]] and [[Blink]] into the room and screaming erupts from the women inside. Shalheira holds a speech that this was the best outcome they could've gotten, as we initially set our thoughts to getting rid of the [[Frozen Roses]]. The mood of the crowd calms down as Shalheira reassures them that we wont sell them out.

Aust and Rotom tell the crowd about the lotteries, that they're rigged, about Ivahn and Gareth that we saved, but eventually got killed.

Aedan finds Tinna Rielsbarrow, a woman from [[Good Mead]] he knows as the sister of the speaker there. Tinna tells Aedan that that Good Mead is doing fine, but that she's worried about [[Dougan's Hole]]. Speakers there requires townsfolk to leave their door open to sacrifice the heat. Anyone who freezes to death is their sacrifice to Auril for the time being.

Aedan also asks about the claw he found, Tinna mentions that it is from a ghoul Shalheira sometimes summons. It would have a chilling effect. Shalheira would use the ghoul as guards.

We ask Shalheira about the [[Creed of Auril]]. Led by druids who believes Auril is acting out and need to show her more devotion and cruelty to keep her satisfied. Leadership of the Creed meet in a Frost Giant cave near the Sea of Moving Ice, called Grimskalle. Shalheira has only heard this info. She's seen people commune with Auril, telling a similar story.

Main numbers are the awakened animals that they use for defense, of which they have a lot. They have five frost druids and an ancient priestess, [[Anga Keos]].

I write a letter to [[Speaker Oarus|Oarus]] mentioning that the situation with the [[Frozen Roses]], Adelia's dealt with, that Shalheira wishes to negotiate a deal and stop being persecuted, ending the ransom on their heads. The letter is written it in such a way that it would come over as trustworthy enough.

We take a long rest, some of us sleep inside the tavern inside the hideout, other sleep in Santiago's hut outside.

Thanking Shalheira for the shelter for the night, we set off towards the [[The Dark Duchess]], the ship that [[Santiago Cruz de los Santos|Santiago]] and [[Vellynne Harpell]] are looking for.

We travel through the Lonelywood forest, leading west and crossing the river leading to Maer Dualdon.

We almost trip over three frozen heads in the ground, some of them have scratch marks. Aedan thinks it's a yeti hoard. We don't see the yeti immediately, but we spot tracks in the snow.  We move away, deciding not to find and engage the yeti's.

The sky turns bright colours as it apparently turns to night. Santiago puts up the sleeping dome again. Aust and I take watch. It starts snowing pretty heavily, covering the dome in snow. Early in the night during my watch, i hear sniffing outside the dome. Carefully clearing some snow, I spot two silver foxes. Suddenly, they're talking in Common! They mention that they've not encountered this hillock before, wondering about it. They start digging and scratch the outside of the dome. I wake Aeden, asking if we should do something with these foxes. At this time, Rotom wakes up and asks what's going on. I tell about the silver foxes. Rotom wants to befriend them and says "hello" through the snow. The silver foxes jump up in a scare and run off. We don;t see them again. Aust leaves some food outside, but that's still there but the morning. 

We set out west again through the tundra. Eventually we see the terrain turn darker further out, which would be the Sea of Moving Ice. We camp out in the dome again. During Rime's watch, he spots large figures moving in the distance. Mammoths from the looks of it. A sudden sounding of a horn causes the group of mammoths to stampede in our direction. As they do, we see they're being hunted by a group of people in the distance.

A mammoth bull and bear are leading a pack of smaller mammoths out of the way of a group of orc hunters. First, we run out of the way. Aedan casts faerie fire to light us up to try and scare the mammoths away from us. Apparently it works, as the pack moves out of our direction. Bear mammoth gets stuck in ice. Santiago casts hypnotic pattern on the bear mammoth, mesmerizing it. The group of hunters starts targeting both a smaller mammoth and the bear. Santiago and Rotom also target the smaller mammoth. The bull notices this and turns around and tries defend his mate and child, but fails to do so. The bear and bull take off with the rest of the mammoths, leaving the heavily wounded child. The orc chief leading the hunters ends the suffering of the child mammoth with its sword.

We talk to the chief orc, who's happy to have managed to kill the smaller mammoth. Santiago and Rotom engage in conversation with the orcs and convince them to take us with them to feast on the successful mammoth hunt.
