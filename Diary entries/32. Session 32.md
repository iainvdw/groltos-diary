# Session 32

Santiago sends in Knobsworth to the child to comfort him, but the kid is still staring scared at Aedan. Aedan walks out the tent and Santiago manages to comfort the kid a bit and learns that the kid was scared of Aedan's moths, carries around souls of the dead.

Meanwhile, Rime talks to the vultures to learn more about what happened. Neither of them have seen [[Auril, The Frostmaiden|Auril]] around, fortunately for them.

Santiago comes out with the kid, still scared. Santiago brings him forward, 

A howl is heard over the camp, but the howl is not something animal. Voice calls out for "ARRIX!". Kid cowers in fear hearing that. I scout ahead, I see four humans walking in the direction the camp. Leather pants, bare chested, one wearing a dire wolf skin.
