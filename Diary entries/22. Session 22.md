# Session 22

Shalheira takes us inside the Frozen Roses hideout, through the mammoth skull. She throws the two heads of [[Adelia]] and [[Blink]] into the room and screaming erupts from the women inside. Shalheira holds a speech that this was the best outcome they could've gotten, as we initially set our thoughts to getting rid of the [[Frozen Roses]]. The mood of the crowd calms down as Shalheira reassures them that we wont sell them out.

Aust and Rotom tell the crowd about the lotteries, that they're rigged, about Ivahn and Gareth that we saved, but eventually got killed.

Aedan finds [[Tinna Rielsbarrow]], a woman from [[Good Mead]] he knows as the sister of the speaker there. Tinna tells Aeden that that Good Mead is doing fine, but that she's worried about [[Dougan's Hole]]. Speakers there requires townsfolk to leave their door open to sacrifice the heat. Anyone who freezes to death is their sacrifice to Auril for the time being.

Aedan also asks about the claw he found, Tinna mentions that it is from a ghoul Shalheira sometimes summons. It would have a chilling effect. Shalheira would use the ghoul as guards.

We ask Shalheira about the [[Creed of Auril]]. Led by druids who believes Auril is acting out and need to show her more devotion and cruelty to keep her satisfied. Leadership of the Creed meet in a Frost Giant cave near the Sea of Moving Ice, called Grimskalle. Shalheira has only heard this info. She's seen people commune with Auril, telling a similar story.

Main numbers are the awakened animals that they use for defense, of which they have a lot. They have five frost druids and an ancient priestess, [[Anga Keos]].

I write a letter to [[Speaker Oarus|Oarus]] mentioning that the situation with the [[Frozen Roses]], Adelia's dealt with, that Shalheira wishes to negotiate a deal and stop being persecuted, ending the ransom on their heads. The letter is written it in such a way that it would come over as trustworthy enough.

We take a long rest, some of us sleep inside the tavern inside hideout
