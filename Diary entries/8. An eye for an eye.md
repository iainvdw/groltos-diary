# An eye for an eye

**18 Nightal - Lonelywood forest**

Rime led us through the dark, old forest. The terrain starts to get more hill-like here, seems like this forest edges the base of [[Kelvin's Cairn]]. We reached a cleared piece of the forest on a snowy hillside. I saw a couple of statues in the distance as we walked closer to the clearing. When we got there, I was able to get a good look at the statues. My gaze immediately went to a familiar figure, the drow statue. That was a statue of the drow necromancer! Why does he have a statue here?!

As I saw this statue, my vision blurred, I got dizzy and got nauseous. Vomited into the snow. Got really anxious at the sight of this statue, seems like I had a panic attack... Took me a while to get myself together and recollect my thoughts. 

While I still felt anxious, I started to take a look at the statues. The was writing behind the status:

> Before you stand the ancients. The champions of Heleg imlad, those who defeated Dur-baagal the Dawn Titan by charge of Auril.

Ancients? _Spirits of the ancients_ perhaps? Like moths to a fucking flame?!

The statues stood on circular bases, standing about 7 foot tall. They looked old, _really old_. Time and icy wind seemed to have torn at these statues for a very long time. They also had some text engraved into it. Seemed like their names, titles and allegiances to some deity. It looks like half of them were somewhat good aligned and the other half evil aligned...

The first statue was of Anga Keos, a High elf. Champion of Auril. Custodian of the Frigid Veil. Auril...

The second statue was of Lyndis Helerora, a Wood elf. Champion of Amaunator, god of the sun. Keeper of all that bears leaf. There are two forest near Ten Towns, would this mean those forests?

The third statue bore the name of Radelia Xillynn, an Eladrin. Champion of Eldath, goddess of the springs. Bringer of fever to Lac and Maer. I suppose this is related to the hot springs of Maer Dualdon? I haven't heard about hot springs near Lac Dinneshere though...

The fourth statue I approached carefully. It was of Omareth Baenre, the drow necromancer that took Yerthid. Champion of Malar, god of the hunt. Sovereign of the Growing Mountain. What mountain is mentioned here? Could this mean [[Kelvin's Cairn]]? I've never heard tales of it growing before...

The fifth statue was of Elmar Elabanise, a sea elf. Champion of Umberlee, goddess of the sea. Tamer of the Sea of Moving Ice. That sea is to the west of here. I've heard tales about how treacherous it is to navigate.

And finally, on the sixth statue, Sahnar of Luruar, a Moon elf. Champion of Mallieki. Light of the Sunless Grove. We've heard about the [[Druid Circle|Loneywood Grove]] being mentioned by [[Amala Bhilar|Amala]], but she didn't call it the Sunless Grove. Considering all of the following: there's no sun here, a moon elf, all the moon symbolism here, would this location be the Sunless Grove itself?

All of these statues seemed to be related to the nature domain.

We decided to look around some more. To the left of the statues there was an opening in the hill side, looking through the opening we saw a circular indentation in the hill with a crystal gnomon standing in the middle. Symbols of the moon phases on the ground. Rotom found something that look liked a smooth stone door to the left of the opening, didn't seem to open from this side. Maybe it was an exit?

Walking around to the right side, we saw a gazebo featuring a brazier in the middle and a set of stairs leading up a 10 foot high ridge around the circular area. Walking up the stairs, we saw a tomb surrounded by five pillars on its eastern side. Rotom cleared the snow of the tomb, which revealed an inscription:

> I stand here to take the vow as the ancients did before me. Hear me, maidens of frost and moon as we kindle and preserve the light. As we isolate and behold beauty in your images. As we slay your enemies without remorse and we endure whatever hardships come before us.

The tomb seemed to be sealed, it wouldn't budge. Santiago had the feeling it might even be a magical seal. Looking at the five pillars next to the tomb, they had symbols on them: a twig, a pine cone, a flame, a feather and a hand. The first three seemed like ingredients for a fire, maybe the feather as well. But the hand?

Aust was looking at another statue at the northern side of the circular clearing. There stood another statue of a woman with an owl face. This had to be a statue of Auril, this is a form people know her by.

Looking to the north of the tomb, there was still the gazebo with the brazier that we didn't take a look at yet. Investigating at the brazier, it contained four of the symbols we just saw, apart from the hand. We figured we might as well try to light the fire to see if we can unlock some secrets of this place. We gathered some wood, pine cones and feathers and put them in the bowl. Rotom got out her tinder box and lit the fire. Nothing happened yet. Thinking about the hand and the possible purpose of this place, it maybe had to do something with sacrifice. Sacrifice a hand perhaps? I pulled off my glove and put my hand in the fire. The looks on everybody's faces changed rapidly when they saw me do that. I've had to withstand much worse during my training as a blood hunter, so this was nothing. The fire responded to my hand by immediately fizzling out. Seems like a live hand isn't the right ingredient...

Aust was exploring around the circular area a bit and came back to us telling there's a cave there with some wolves in it. As he was telling us that, a billowing voice came from the woods: "What are you doing here?!". It was a white moose, its mouth, hooves and antlers covered in blood. Would this have been the moose of the tracks we saw in the woods? Would this same moose have killed the logger we found?

Suddenly it started charging Santiago and grazed him badly with its antlers. Everyone came running back to us to fight it off. Santiago came running back towards me while I started shooting at it with my crossbow. Aust were slashing at it up close, while Rotom made a nasty attack. She stabbed her sword into the side of the moose, used it as a step to get up on its back and then plunged her dagger into its neck, hitting a major vein. 

Marlon was still a little ways off. He came charging in, his short dwarven legs carrying him as fast as they could, battle axe swinging backwards for extra momentum. The moose started to look pretty bad already in the meanwhile. When Marlon got close enough, he plunged his axe in the moose's back using all the momentum from his short sprint, jamming it deep into its spine causing it to collapse to the ground. 

What is with all these talking animals? Why do they turn aggressive to the people? This place might have some answers, so we started to look around. Walking up to the moose to see if I could take anything useful from the moose, I cut out some fine moose steaks and took its antlers. I know that some people in Lonelywood might be interested in these antlers.

After the fight with the moose, we explored the cave with the wolves Aust told us about. In the western wall of the circular opening, there was an entry in the rocky wall with a 10ft drop. We climbed down to see what was in there. As soon as we got down, the wolves started snarling at us, but we managed to distract them with a ration thrown into one corner which they happily started feeding on. Now we could safely explore the cave. Or so we thought.

It was dark in the cave, real dark. We lit a torch so we could better see our surroundings. As soon as the torch flame shed a light, we scanned the interior. More statues inside here, a couple of paths and a flight of stairs. We found two more bodies slumped down against the cave wall, snow in their mouths and eyes. Upon closer inspection, we found two more wooden rings on them, with the same inscription as the ones we found in the forest. Lonelywood Logging Company. Looks like we found three dead loggers already...

On the cave walls, there were inscriptions written in charcoal all over the place. Aust managed to read a couple of them. One inscription in particular noticed his eye, which he immediately dismissed as "elven shit":

> And thus by their charge they did slay the frigid leviathan and prevented the growth of Crenshinibon.
 
So these statues outside, were they warriors led to battle by Auril to slay some kind of enemy of theirs? Seems like they did. But how does this all tie into the murders and the worshiping of Auril? Seems like we need to investigate a bit more.

Taking a closer look at the other writings on the walls, we found a list of names and locations, some of them crossed out.

**Crossed out:**
- Falpher Proudfoot (Dougans Hole)
- Hedvig Stonemaul (Good Mead)
- Coster Wolclaw (Targos)
- Ivahn & Gareth of Daerlun (Targos / Termalaine)

**Not crossed out:**
- Naerth Maxildanarr (Targos)
- Amala Bhilar (Termalaine)
- Rotom Moonbane (Termalaine)
- Santiago de los Cruz Santos (Termalaine)
- Marlon Tayte (Termalaine)
- Grolto Granitemuncher (Termalaine)
- Kadroth (Caer Dineval)
- Avarice (Caer Dineval)

Most of these names are familiar. The crossed out names are the recent murder victims, so it seems like this list is a kill list of all their targets. Some curious names on there as well. Speaker Naerth, for cheating with the lottery perhaps? Amala Bhilar, because she rejected Ravisin's offer? All of our group's names are on there as well, apart from Aust. Why is Aust not on there? Thinking of all the elven statues, would he not be on this list because he is an elf? 

Suddenly, a voice echoed through the cave, coming from the stairs: "Blightmane, Icefang, we have visitors!". The wolves stopped eating the rations we threw at them, and stared at the stairs. We heard steps coming down revealing a familiar figure in the dark. Light skin, dark sleek hair, two ice daggers in his hands. It was Henrack!

Doubting for a second if we should engage in conversation with him, I reckoned that would be fruitless as he coldheartedly murdered people. So instead, I did what I though was best: fire my crossbow at him to start taking him down. This kicked off the toughest fight we've had since we grouped together.

Santiago ran up to him and started shouting in his face, trying to intimidate Henrack. It didn't phase him the slightest, looking back at Santiago with a smirk. It did scare off the wolves however, who crawled into a corner whining. We knew Henrack had some magical abilities, but it turned out we didn't see his full potential. Pointing his hand towards the two dead bodies of the loggers, he started uttering a few words. The corpses behind Aust and Marlon started moving and standing up, turned into ghouls, immediately attacking both of them. Aust shouted a few words at Santiago, Rotom and me, his voice powerfully echoing through the cave. These divine words empowered us with a blessing to have an edge in this battle. Then, Aust and Marlon started focusing on the ghouls, plunging their axes into these walking corpses.

Rotom took out her bow and also started firing at Henrack, so that it was now Santiago, Rotom and me fighting Henrack. We managed to get a couple of good hits on him.

Henrack then used his ability again to instantly teleport right in my face. He slashed at me and Santiago using his icy daggers, taunting me after a couple of hits: "Come on then, bring it".

A crossbow doesn't do much good in close quarters battle, so I dropped my crossbow and pulled out my rapier. Got a few good hits on him after a few slashes, taunting him back: "Gotcha, how's that?". I did see that his previous wounds were starting to close already. Seems like he recovers quickly, so it's important we take him out quickly.

Meanwhile, Aust and Marlon were making quick work of the ghouls, but they did take quite a beating themselves as well. One of the wolves seemed to have shaken off its fear of Santiago and started attacking Rotom from behind. The other wolf was still cowering in a corner, trembling with fear, its eyes focused on Santiago's every move. Rotom engaged the wolf that attacked her, making quick work of it with a few nasty strikes.

We started to wear down Henrack, and he started looking worse and worse. Realizing that himself, he teleported up the stairs again, seemingly wanting to escape. Santiago ran after him to try to stop him. The stairs were just out of my view, so I moved around a bit to get a clearer view on Henrack to fire my crossbow at him again. Rotom, now free of the wolf, also ran after Henrack getting in a couple of good strikes. 

Aust and Marlon managed to take care of the ghouls and wolves in the meanwhile, with a couple of heavy strikes of their axes. They did take quite a beating in this battle though, seemingly surprised at the unexpected power of these seemingly lesser foes.

Henrack was starting to look real bad and more desperate to get away. Henrack ran up the stairs, up to what we could now see was a smooth stone slab, blocking Henrack's path. It seemed like a door of some kind, but could not be opened from this side. Henrack started shouting, "My love, let me in! Open the door!". We figured we had to move quick, before he would manage to escape. Fortunately for us, his cries went unanswered and the door remained closed.

Seeing him in this state made me want to trap him real good. I uttered the words of the binding curse to get him to stay put for a short while. I managed to hit him with another crossbow bolt, Santiago slashed at him with his rapier and Rotom managed to get the killing blow with an arrow straight in his chest. Henrack collapsed to his knees as the life left him, or whatever seemed to masquerade as life. Thinking we were done with Henrack, his body started moving again. Was he still healing, even after we killed him? Rotom an I fired a couple more bolts and arrows in him, but he still kept on healing and starting to wake up. Santiago, fed up with this bullshit, got out his rapier and started cutting his head off. That did seem to do the trick, as that stopped him from healing back up.

We walked down the stairs to regroup with Aust and Marlon, to assess the situation. Everyone looked pretty beat up and Santiago and Aust were also out of healing options. We decided to investigate a bit and then take a short rest before we would leave again.

We searched Henrack's body for clues and we found a couple of interesting things. The first thing we found on his body, were his bracers. Santiago sensed they were magical, and upon closer inspection we learned that Henrack used these bracers to summon his magical ice daggers.

Taking his bracers off his arm, it revealed a tattoo. It said "Prisoner #274" on his arm. The others figured that would have made him an ex-convict or fugitive from Revel's End Prison. This apparently is a high security prison in the area for the worst of the worst.

Finally, we found a small piece of shark skin in one of his pockets, that had a crude map drawn on it:

![[henrack-shark-skin-map.jpg]]

I recognized one of the locations on there, [[Bremen]]. The others did not ring a bell, so we might want to investigate some time when we are in the area.

Santiago spotted a spider crawling on the ceiling. I didn't give it much notice, as it isn't uncommon for spiders to crawl around dank spaces. Santiago however, got out a dagger and threw it at the spider. It was quite an impressive throw as it hit the relatively small spider. After the hit, the spider fell down right at our feet and it suddenly turned into a black haired druid-like woman. Was this Ravisin?! Before we could even flinch, she muttered a few words causing a freezing hailstorm to appear right above us, bombarding everybody with massive chilling hail stones.

And then, it went black...
