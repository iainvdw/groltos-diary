**25 Nightal - Shadowreach**
 
 We reach a tunnel with the walls engraved in stars. The floor starts to crunch beneath our feet, as we look down, thick layer of white moths. Is new according to Niilrash.
 
 We continue, reach a plateau with a broken bridge. Body in the middle of the plateau, stone giant. Aust senses two undead creatures, we keep quiet. I inspect the stone giant, skull has been cracked open, brain is missing.
