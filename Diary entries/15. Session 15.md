# Session 15

**25 Nightal - Shadowreach**
 
 We reach a tunnel with the walls engraved in stars. The floor starts to crunch beneath our feet, as we look down, thick layer of white moths. Is new according to Niilrash.
 
 We continue, reach a plateau with a broken bridge. Body in the middle of the plateau, stone giant. Aust senses two undead creatures, we keep quiet. I inspect the stone giant, skull has been cracked open, brain is missing. Santiago peeks over the edge and sees a creature, tentacles from his head, teethy, undead. Describes the creature to us, but doesn't ring any bells.
 
 Aust is suddenly snatched by tentacles coming over the edge, grabbing his ankles and pulling him over the edge. We hear his scream come from just over the edge, staying there. Not falling, hanging there while the creature. I off one with two crossbow bolts, Aedan pulls up the other with grabbing Aust with a thorn whip.
 
 We fight off two vampiric mind flayers.
