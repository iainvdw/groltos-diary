# Suffering Stone

**25 Nightal - Shadowreach**

[[Nillrash]] takes us out of town through the western gate and we head down a winding path towards the valley of [[Shadowreach]]. Eventually we reach a tunnel, its walls engraved in red stars. After a few minutes walking through the tunnel, we feel something beneath our feet. It starts crunching more and more with every step we take. Inspecting the tunnel floor, we see that we're walking on dead moths and the layer gets thicker and thicker the further we walk into the tunnel. Inquiring with Niilrash, these moths were not here before, so this is a recent development. [[Omareth Baenre|Omareth]] probably has something to do with this...

As we continue down the tunnel, eventually we reach a plateau with a broken bridge on the opposite side of us. In the middle of the plateau we spot a body lying on the floor. Running over to it, we discover it's the body of a stone giant, its skull having been split open. I notice that the brain cavity is empty, its brain is missing, nowhere to be seen. 

[[Aust Rime|Aust]] walks over to the edge of the plateau and warns us that he senses two undead creatures nearby, hiding over the edge of the plateau. [[Santiago Cruz de los Santos|Santiago]] carefully walks over to the ledge, spotting the creature and describing it to us. It's a skinny creature, teethy tentacles protruding from its head, looks quite undead. The description doesn't ring a bell with any of us, although a head with tentacles somewhat sounds like a mindflayer. Aedan and I walk over to Santiago and also spot the creature.

Suddenly we hear a scream, tentacles have snatched Aust by his ankles, pulling him over the edge. His scream doesn't seem to ebb away, which means he's probably still just below the edge. There are two creatures near us, both start moving towards us. I manage to kill one with two shots from my crossbow, while Aedan uses his thorn whip and pulls it up on the plateau. Now it's up close, I can see clearer what it looks like. It's similar to a mind flayer, but possesses this feral look to it, nothing like the intelligent creatures I've learned about during my training.

Aedan, Santiago and I fought and killed the one on our side, while Rotom was aiding Aust in fighting off the other one while trying to get a hold of some rock to climb back up. During the fight, the creature struggles to maintain its grip on the cavern wall and drops down. Aust finally manages to climb up top. Looking over the edge we can't see the creature anymore, as the drop is very, very deep.

Walking over to the creature we killed up on the plateau, I start inspecting the body. It's similar to a mind flayer, but it seems undead. The teeth protruding from its tentacles are also uncommon, nothing I've seen or learned of before. Using a knife, I start opening its head and torso to learn what this thing is. Inside of it, I find sacs filled with some kind of fluid, its stomach is filled with brain matter. These sacs are filled with spinal and cranial fluid... Now I start to recognise what hese are: [[Vampiric mind flayers]]. I've heard of the mind flayer city back down below, that's being ruled by an Elder Brain, which is something of a hive mind to all mind flayers. These creatures probably bring it the cerebrospinal fluids that they manage to harvest from their victims. It's a good thing we managed to kill these...

In the meanwhile, [[Niilrash]] has been preparing ropes and pitons for the climb down. Looking over the edge, I can just barely make out the shape of a large spike of chardalyn bursting from the ground. As we prepare to climb down, Santiago calls my name. As I turn around and look at him, this evil grin is staring back at me when he grabs me firmly by the shoulder and pushes both of us over the edge, into the abyss. The rush of wind while we're falling is 

==========================================
 
 
 We fight off two vampiric mind flayers. Niilrash starts preparing pitons, ropes and crampons for the climb down in the cavern. Santiago casts a spell and throws me and himself off of the cliff, causing us to float down instead of having to climb down.
 
 As I take a look around, I see a large chunk of chardalyn having burst from the ground here as well. As everyone reaches the ground below, we hear loud stomping coming from behind us. Niilrash assures us that these might be one of the remaining stone giants, native to this place. We see two figures approaching, Niilrash walks up to them, greeting them with a wave. One of them reaches for a boulder and throws it at Niilrash, who barely dodges it.
 
 Aedan notices a mind flayer above on the other side of the bridge, shouting commands down at the stone giants. Aedan mentions that there is a mind flayer, which has me firing two shots from my light crossbow. One misses, the other one hits, after which I suddenly see a vision of Yerthid appear behind it, whispering in my thoughts "We want the same thing, we want to get rid of Omareth". I yell back that it then should stop attacking us, to which it replies that it's not done yet. Aedan also shoots his longbow at it.
 
 The rest is fending off the stone giants, who snap out of their controlled state after a couple of light hits. We start talking about what happened. They seem to have been under mind flayer control for a couple of cycles. We ask them for help fending off the mindflayer, but they're unresponsive to the request, not worried about the mindflayer being able to affect Gorom.
 
 We leave for their settlement to meet their shaman, who speaks to Gorom the most often. A female stone giant with smears of coal on her face greets us and asks us in Giant if we came to hurt them, Aedan convinces them that we're only trying to reach Gorom and speak to him. The shaman is worried that we're also infected by the mindflayer, but we assure her we aren't. She tells us why she's worried, as there are a few other stone giants in an unconscious state, having been affected by the mind flayer. Asks us how we restored the two that attacked us.
 
 She informs us about the situation with the mind flayer, that they lost a couple in a battle and some escaped. We convince her that we want to go to Gorom, she makes a potion which makes us turn to stone and then suggests that we walk through the wall towards Gorom. We thank her and start walking through the mountain, until we reach a ruined chamber, where a large stone sword has pierced a stone giant's skull. Behind it, we see the mindflayer seemingly talking to something we can't see, behind a corner.
 
 Santiago jumps out of the mountain wall and starts conversing with the mindflayer, ruining our surprise ambush. The mindflayer tells Santiago Aust, Aedan and Rotom start attacking it. Aust casts a spell from his new axe causing its metal breastplate to light up red hot, causing it to scream in pain as the armor sears into its flesh. Aedan throws the flask of alchemist's fire on top of the mind flayer, burning it even more. At this point, the mindflayers splits into four duplicates, scattered across the hall leading towards Gorom.
 
 Four small rodents pop up from behind us, shrieking at us and attacking us.
