# Session 8

Rime led us through the dark, old forest. The terrain starts to get more hill-like here, seems like this forest edges the base of [[Kelvin's Cairn]]. We reached a cleared piece of the forest on a snowy hillside. I saw a couple of statues in the distance as we walked closer to the clearing. When we got there, I was able to get a good look at the statues. My gaze immediately went to a familiar figure, the drow statue. That was a statue of the drow necromancer! Why does he have a statue here?!

As I saw this statue, my vision blurred, I got dizzy and got nauseous. Vomited into the snow. Got really anxious at the sight of this statue, seems like I had a panic attack... Took me a while to get myself together and recollect my thoughts. 

While I still felt anxious, I started to take a look at the statues. The was writing behind the status:

> Before you stand the ancients. The champions of Heleg imlad, those who defeated Dur-baagal the Dawn Titan by charge of Auril.

Every statue also had some text engraved into it. Seemed like their names, titles and allegiances to some deity. Seemed like half were somewhat good aligned and the other half evil aligned...

The first statue was of Anga Keos, a High elf. Champion of Auril and Custodian of the Frigid Veil.

The second statue was of Lyndis Helerora, a Wood elf. Champion of Amaunator, god of the sun. Keeper of all that bears leaf.

The third statue bore the name of Radelia Xillynn, an Eladrin. Champion of Eldath, godess of the springs. Bringer of fever to Lac and Maer. I suppose this is releated to the hot springs of Maer Dualdon and Lac Dinneshere?

The fourth statue I approached carefully. It was of Omareth Baenre, the drow necromancer that took Yerthid. Champion of Malar, god of the hunt. Sovereign of the Growing Mountain. What mountain is mentioned here? Could this mean [[Kelvin's Cairn]]? I've never heard tales of it growing before...

The fifth statue was of Elmar Elabanise, a sea elf. Champion of Umberlee, godess of the sea. Tamer of the Sea of Moving Ice. That sea is to the west of here. I've heard tales about how treacherous it is to navigate.

And finally, on the sixth statue, Sahnar of Luruar, a Moon elf. Champion of Mallieki. Light of the Sunless Grove. We've heard about the [[Druid Circle|Loneywood Grove]] being mentioned by [[Amala Bhilar|Amala]], but she didn't call it the Sunless Grove. Considering all of the following: there's no sun here, a moon elf, all the moon symbolism here, would this location be the Sunless Grove itself?





 Damage by wind. Dirty, black gunk on it.

All deities of the statues are of the nature domain.

Pillars at tomb: twig, pine cone, flame, feather, humanoid hand

There's a brazier that's emanating some sort of magic. It had inscriptions matching the pillars and we gathered them. We were still missing the hand, so I put my hand in the fire.

Another statue, it's of Auril.

Suddenly a moose behind us. It charged Santiago. Pierced Aust's armor. Fought and  killed it.

Went downstairs in the cave. Two dead bodies, snow in mouths and eye sockets. Rings on them, more Lonelywood Logging Company bodies.

Inscription on the wall: "And thus by their charge they did slay the frigid leviathann and prevented the growth of Crenshinibon." More writing in charcoal on the walls.

Hear a voice coming from the stairs. "Blightmane, Icefang, we have visitors!". Wolves seem startled.

It's Henrack! Fire crossbow at him. Santiago tries to intimidate him, seems to have no effect, but wolves scared. Henrack summons the loggers back to life. We killed off the ghouls and wolves. After some fighting we managed to kill of Henrack. Came back to life. Chopped his head off.

Prisoner 274 tattoo on Henrack's lower arm. Seemed to be from Revel's End Prison. Had a magical bracer. Piece of shark skin with writing on it.

Spider on the ceiling. Santiago threw a dagger at it, hitting it. It fell down and turned into Ravisin. Santiago tried to intimidate her to stay down, but she cast a spell to hurl ice at us and then it went black.
