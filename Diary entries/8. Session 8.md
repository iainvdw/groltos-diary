"Before you stand the ancients. The champions of Heleg imlad, those who defeated Dur-baagal the Dawn Titan by charge of Auril"

Massive statues, 7ft high, cylindrical base. Damage by wind. Dirty, black gunk on it.

All deities of the statues are of the nature domain.

Pillars at tomb: twig, pine cone, flame, feather, humanoid hand

There's a brazier that's emanating some sort of magic. It had inscriptions matching the pillars and we gathered them. We were still missing the hand, so I put my hand in the fire.

Another statue, it's of Auril.

Suddenly a moose behind us. It charged Santiago. Pierced Aust's armor. Fought and  killed it.

Went downstairs in the cave. Two dead bodies, snow in mouths and eye sockets. Rings on them, more Lonelywood Logging Company bodies.

Inscription on the wall: "And thus by their charge they did slay the frigid leviathann and prevented the growth of Crenshinibon." More writing in charcoal on the walls.

It's a list of names and locations, some crossed through:

Hear a voice coming from the stairs. "Blightmane, Icefang, we have visitors!". Wolves seem startled.

It's Henrack! Fire crossbow at him. Santiago tries to intimidate him, seems to have no effect, but wolves scared. Henrack summons the loggers back to life. We killed off the ghouls and wolves. After some fighting we managed to kill of Henrack. Came back to life. Chopped his head off.

Prisoner 274 tattoo on Henrack's lower arm. Seemed to be from Revel's End Prison. Had a magical bracer. Piece of shark skin with writing on it.

Spider on the ceiling. Santiago threw a dagger at it, hitting it. It fell down and turned into Ravisin. Santiago tried to intimidate her to stay down, but she cast a spell to hurl ice at us and then it went black.
