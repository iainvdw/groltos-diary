# Deep Reaching Shadows

It started to seem the tides were turning in our favour, as we managed to fend off large parts of the invasion already and there was a dead [[Zombie Beholder]] in front of me.

- I turned around and ran my way back into town, climbing back up the guard tower. Once I got up top and took a moment to glance back over the town, I noticed a pale figure in red robes rising from The Drop. The Mastermind of this undead invasion managed to get into the center of town! [[Aedan]] also seemed to have spotted them as he aimed his longbow towards it.

Suddenly, I spot [[Bailon the Beardless|Bailon]] running towards the north gate, his eyes glowing red. He suddenly stops and starts shouting a spell, causing the portcullis to shatter into pieces.

From the other tower, Aedan must have realised what threat this leader posed to all of us and the town, launching a volley of arrows towards the Mastermind. This seems to cause it to lose the control it had over Bailon, who's now standing confused and angry in front of the shattered gate.

The Mastermind seemed to have noticed me as a massive blast of black energy targets me, causing a massive wound and pinning me to the wall with slimy, black tentacles. I scream towards Aedan and Bailon for help in panic, forgetting for a moment that Bailon was not himself just a moment ago.

I break free from the black tentacles and run down the stairs of tower, hiding myself from this powerful mage.

 Bailon turns around and runs towards the Mastermind's location, throwing a handful of pebbles at the Mastermind. I was confused at first, but as soon as the pebbles hit the Mastermind, it seemed to have a controlling effect on them as they started to count the pebbles on the floor.

As it seemed just a bit safer, I ran out of the tower towards Bailon. Asking if he has any healing potions, he nods his head down at his belt, where I spot two healing potions. I take and drink one, easing my pain and somewhat closing my wounds.

I see another volley of arrows get launched from Aedan's tower, the arrows taking off chunks of dead flesh from the Mastermind. They're starting to look quite wounded, for something undead that is.

The Mastermind looks in Aedan's direction, points they're hand towards the tower and utters a spell. As I look back, Aedan's eyes are now glowing red. The Mastermind must have put Aedan under a spell, controlling him. The Mastermind seems to want to get out of here, having met their match. They move towards The Drop and start to fly down, descend into the deep hole.

Seeing the Mastermind wanting to flee, Bailon runs up to them and tries to swing twice at it with his axes, but sadly misses both attacks.

In a desperate attempt to try and stop the Mastermind from escaping, I run up to the edge of The Drop and invoke my blood curse of binding on it to stop it from moving. This must have also broken its ability to fly, as it starts falling down the pit. Suddenly, I spot [[Rotom Moonbane|Rotom]] and [[Santiago Cruz de los Santos|Santiago]] at the bottom of the pit, so I shout down that they should watch out. The Mastermind crashes into the icy walls a couple of times during its fall, until eventually it breaks into a pile of dead flesh and bones at the bottom of the frozen waterfall. 

===============================

I run up to the hole and use my blood curse of binding on him, causing him to lose his flying ability and drop down the hole. The Mastermind smacks against the walls a few times, before crashing into the floor at the bottom. While its falling, I see Rotom and Santiago at the bottom, yell that something's incoming. Some flesh and bones drop right on their head. I yell that they should get their asses back up here, but the seem to ignore my call. I run back to the north gate to fend of the rest of the zombies.

After the demise of the Mastermind, the undead horde seems to calm down and stop in their tracks, mindlessly wandering about.

Dwarven entourage with [[King Baerick Battlehammar]] and [[Vellynne Harpell]] arrives, blasting undead while they're moving towards the town. Stone giants arrive in town as well.

Vellynne finds me, inquires about the kobold messenger that was sent to her by Rotom. She's looking for her to thank her. I gather Aedan and Rime, walk toward The Drop and we drop down as Vellynne casts a spell allowing us to drop slowly towards Santiago and Rotom's tiny hideout they've cast down at the bottom.

All of us drop through the bubble of the sanctuary, apart from Vellynne, who lightly smacks against the surface as Santiago and Rotom are hesitant to allow Vellynne into the hut. After some discussion, not entirely trusting Vellynne's intentions, they allow her in after she seems forthright. Vellynne offers us a job to investigate the lost city of [[Ythryn]], and a ship called The Dark Duchess. As she was researching Shadowreach, which has now been overflowed with undead, she needs to look for other places to continue her researhc. Vellyne believes the ship contains some research documents of great value to her. 

She also asks us if we are still looking for Naz, her colleague north of [[Lonelywood]]. She's willing to help and reward us if we help her out with these requests.

We set out towards Ten Towns again. Vellynne mentioned the dwarves of [[Battlehammar Hold]] made us all mythril armour as a reward for saving [[King Baerick Battlehammar]].
