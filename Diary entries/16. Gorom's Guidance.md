# Gorom's Guidance

A stone hall unfolds before my eyes with columns of precisely cut black stone. Etchings are carved into the stone, but they seem to be moving. Looking around, I see [[Aedan]] beside me. We're in this dream together. Down the hall we both spot a cloaked figure in the distance. We can't make out who or what it is yet, so Aedan and I decide to approach it. When we get closer, we see that it's [[Gorom]], now in a bodily form looking very similar to the stone giants we encountered earlier.

Gorom sees us approaching and addresses us, that this is indeed a dream and that he can better show us some things this way. He's willing to answer our questions and has brought Aedan and I together in this as our fates have converged regarding [[Omareth Baenre|Omareth]]. Aedan allows me to ask my questions first, so I go ahead and ask them of Gorom. 

The first thing I want to know, is why Omareth is here. Gorom tells me that Omareth is here because of Crenshinibon, as it's a beacon from a distant place. He wants to study it and use it to take revenge on a rival, one of the Netherese mages of Yithryn. Asking where Omareth resides, Gorom answers that he's in the Black Cathedral. Fellow wizards of the Red Star created it as a monument to Crenshinibon. Gorom also confirms to me that Omareth is not just a necromancer, but has ascended to lichdom. Knowing a thing or two about liches, I ask where its phylactery is, to which Gorom replies that the entire mountain is its phylactery. Omareth is a lot more stronger than I previously thought...

Now it's Aedan's turn to ask some questions about his bee swarm, why did they disappear and why they have turned to moths. Gorom replies that his ancients are not returning as they're trapped inside the mountain. Gorom wants to show us what the moths are and asks us to follow him. Gorom turns around and we start following him. It starts to snow, but it's not normal snow. It's snowing moths.

We walk outside and we can feel it getting colder and colder. The moth snow is now mixed with regular snow, almost indistinguishable from each other. Gorom takes a rod out of his cloak and thrusts it into the ground, forming a bubble around us, protecting us from harm and the freezing cold.

In the distance we see the three lakes of Icewind Dale, but there's no mountain. [[Kelvin's Cairn]] is nowhere to be seen. This must have been quite a while in the past. Floating above the horizon, we spot a floating city. The sky lights up as we see a glowing stripe fall from the sky, getting bigger and bigger, falling faster and faster towards the valley, until it crashes down. It carves a valley into the ground, moving massive amounts of earth and stone, forming both the locations we know as the Dwarven Valley and Kelvin's Cairn.

We see creatures coming out of the mountain, they're mind flayers. Gorom tells the crashing asteroid is how mind flayers ended up here. The asteroid is Crenshinibon. The monolith we spotted in [[Shadowreach]] was a kind of emergency beacon asking for help.

Omareth recognized the power of Crenshinibon and started working it in his favour, angering the mind flayers. That must be the reason why the mind flayer also wanted to stop Omareth. Moths started to appear because of Omareth's tampering, as they're actually souls of the dead that are trapped on this plane, lured to the mountain. Lured like moths to a flame, to feed Omareth's power. Every soul that's released by a death within a large vicinity around Kelvin's Cairn is attracted to the mountain, powering Omareth and his phylactery.

Aedan asks Gorom if there exists a power strong enough to compete with Omareth. He tells us that the floating city of Yithryn was able to float as it was powered by a Mythallar, a giant Netherese object allowing access to raw and immense amounts of magical power. Pointing out over the landscape, Gorom shows us how the impact of the asteroid and its resulting shockwave fling the city of Yithryn out of the sky, causing it to veer west, land on its side and get covered by large amounts of material from the asteroid explosion. Looking at the location where this is unfolding, Aedan guesses that the city is now part of the Reghed glacier.

There's another question I've been looking to answer for ages, about Yerthid. I've never been able to determine if Yerthid's truly dead and I've been speaking to her from some afterlife, or if her soul was just separated from her body. Asking this of Gorom, I hear the words I want to hear: Yerthid is not dead. It's actually her soul I carry in my silver locket. She can be revived by someone powerful enough to

==========================

I ask about Yerthid, her soul was not taken into the phylactery. Her soul is in my locket. She can be revived by someone powerful enough to revive someone from the dead.

Gorom thanks us for helping him taking care of the mind flayer that was tormenting him. Gorom explains that there was a rival clan of frost giants that were at war with the stone giants. Most of the stone giants withdrew into rock, Gorom withdrew into chardalyn and hasn't been able to get out since. Has been giving him dreams and visions.

Mindflayer was asking questions about Omareth as well, wanted to know where he was hiding. Disliked that the beacon was know being used by Omareth. More mindflayers are incoming to try to deal with Omareth. We need to take care of Omareth before the mindflayers start dealing with him, possibly turning Omareth into a mindflayer lich.

Aedan asks about allies. There was a place where stone giants would meet, called Jarlmoot. Reghed tribes might be allies. Some might be harder to deal with than others. If we need to know something about places to the west of the mountain, we need to seek out Angajuk. Summon him through a bell, stationary on the shores.

Dream concludes. Etchings on the pillars calm down, move slower and slower. We wake up in the den.

We go back to Deepdelver's Enclave, share stories.

Suddenly bells ring and a dwarven woman start shouting commands to prepare the defenses, closing the entrances and preparing the ballistae. Peeking over the pallisades, we see Shadowreach infested with undead, hundreds of walking corpses and flying figures. All bear a glowing red star.

We start rushing towards the north entrance of town to see how we can defend ourselves. Santiago asks the dwarves at the northern gate how to collapse the path leading to the north and west entrances. I mention this is a mining town, they might have explosives lying around. 

I run towards the mining company's building and barge through the door. The proprietor asks what my business is there and I explain the situation, that we need explosives. He's hesitant at first but I managed to convince him to give us their crates of dynamite. At that point Santiago rushes in to help. He commands two dwarves to collapse the path of the western entrance. We run to the northern entrance.

Santiago runs down the northern path with a couple of sticks and blows the path at the bottom and half-way. I use them to tie to my try to make explosive bolts. While I'm doing that, Jayce spots me and chuckles seeing what I'm trying to attempt. She asks me to follow her as she has something better. I run with her towards her shop where she hands me three metal balls, which are highly explosive she tells me. Much better than my explosive bolts.
