# 4. Gloom and Gems

It's pitch black in the middle of the night. My locket grows warm on my chest. Someone calls my name. I wake up. "Grolto, are you awake, my dear?" Instinctively, I grab my locket and open it. It's Yerthid, she's talking to me. It's so good to hear her voice again, although it instills great sadness and anger again. I look over to Kesni, she's sound asleep. Didn't hear a thing. 

Yerthid warned me of an evil presence downstairs, where everybody is sleeping. I got up as quickly and silently as possible and went downstairs. No thing to be seen there, but Yerthid insists something, or someone, is here. Then I hear Santiago talking in his sleep: "Yes, my Dark Duchess". This doesn't bode well. Another thing we have to talk about, aside from guard situation in Targos... Yerthid then mentioned that the presence had left. Hmm, must have either been invisible, perhaps on a different plane? Not sure though. After taking a look around to make sure everyone's safe, I went back upstairs. Tucked Kesni in and went back to bed.

In the morning all of us had breakfast downstairs. We had barely finished or we were startled by shouting outside: "They're dead! Gareth and Ivahn, they're dead!". It was [[#Marta Peskryk]], the daughter of Clyde who runs the Blue Clam. Well, this is rather unfortunate. We investigated the room they were staying in, but didn't find many clues aside from some boot prints outside the window, a white owl feather and a note saying "Auril always gets her due". Guess we got that coming for us, meddling with Auril's sacrifices. Should've known better... We tried to see if we could track the flight path of the owl, but the tracks ran dead in the forest.

We reported what we discovered to Oarus and the set foot towards the mine. After all, we promised to help him with the kobold situation there.
