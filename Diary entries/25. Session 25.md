# Session 25

**15 Deep Winter - Bryn Shander**

Three kobolds plouging snow in front of Cold Comforts Inn. Rotom gives them each a silver piece. Other two are inside with Oarus.

Oarus and [[Shalheira]] are talking in the tavern. There to present their case to council of speakers.

Lots of people coming in from other towns who are having trouble living there, mainly from [[Caer-Dineval]] and [[Targos]]. Some speakers arrived early to talk to each other one on one, people who they can trust.

Outside we see people shoveling snow. Houses are like Viking architecture, lots of woodwork.

Stables, leatherworkers, smithies, jewelers.

Art shop, Wonderous Treasures.

Jeweler, ivory and scrimshaw, Ithelor's Finery.

We sell of art items and jewelry for 3350gp.

Gold Cask Leatherworks, ask if the grell tentacles can be added to Santiago's Tentacle Rod. She will take a look, come back tomorrow.

There's rumour of an adventurer in town, that might have some work and gear for us. Lives in a hovel two doors down from the Council Hall. Ren Eaves lives here. Sit down near the hearth, two bookshelves with books of his adventurs. Simple kitchen area next to it.

Book cases are filled to the brim with lots of books, some scrolls and various items. Bags, ceramic jugs painted with fisherman, long piece of metal with head of walrus and wolf's head on either end.
