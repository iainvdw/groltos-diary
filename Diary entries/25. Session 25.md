# Session 25

**15 Deep Winter - Bryn Shander**

We have been travelling for a while now and passed through Bremen to stock up on some food and rations for the journey ahead towards [[Bryn Shander]], [[Termalaine]] and [[Battlehammar Hold]]. 

After a few days we reach the outer gates of Bryn Shander, the largest town in [[Ten Towns]]. It's surrounded by a palisade, with guard towers near the entrances. As we pass through the gates and ride into town to find a tavern and a few shops, [[Rotom Moonbane|Rotom]] notices three kobolds ploughing snow outside the Cold Comforts Inn. Rotom jumps down from her mountain goat and greets them, the kobolds immediately bowing to their queen. Rotom asks what they are doing and where the other two are. The kobolds reply that they're here with [[Speaker Oarus|Oarus]] who's in the tavern with the other two kobolds. Rotom thanks them and hands them a silver piece each. The kobolds gratefully thank Rotom and run inside the tavern, asking us to follow them to Oarus.

We dismount our mountain goats and tie them to a few posts outside the tavern and follow Rotom and her kobold pack inside the tavern. There, we see Oarus sitting at a table together with [[Shalheira]]. I greet them as we walk over to their table and they invite us to join them and talk about our recent adventures. 

Oarus and Shalheira are here for the Council of Speakers, the periodical gathering of all Speakers of Ten Towns where they discuss recent events and future policy. One of the things they're here to discuss is the recent influx of people coming into Bryn Shander from other towns. Seemingly they're people who've fled the towns who are ruled by devout followers of the [[Creed of Auril]], trying to get away from the sacrifices and abysmal conditions under which they had to live. Most of the new folk here came from [[Caer-Dineval]] and [[Targos]], two towns with Speakers who we know are worshipers of [[Auril, The Frostmaiden|Auril]]. The council meeting is due tomorrow, but some speakers who trust each other have come early in town to discuss issues ahead of the council meeting.

We drink and talk for a bit and then leave Oarus and Shalheira to their business as we have our own business to attend to. Looking around town for some suitable places to offload our stolen dragon hoard, we find a couple of shops who take interest in some of our items. An art shop called Wondrous Treasures takes the more artistic items off of our hands, while a jeweller's shop by the name of Ithelor's Finery is keen to buy the various gems, jewelry and ivory carvings. It takes us a couple of hours of finding suitable shops and bartering for prices, but eventually we manage to get about 3350 gold pieces for the various items we sell.

On the way back to the Cold Comforts Inn, I keep my eyes open for a leatherworker and find one called Gold Cask Leatherworks. Inside a couple of halflings are working on various pieces of clothing and armour. Taking out the various tentacles I still carry in my backpack, I ask the woman who's in charge if they can do anything with this. The vampiric mind flayer tentacles have shrivelled up quite a bit and have lost their usefulness. However, the [[Grell]] tentacles are still in a good enough condition to be added to Santiago's Tentacle Rod. She said that she could take a look and asks me to return tomorrow.

Asking around town for some other place to buy some upgraded equipment, there is no real magic item shop around Bryn Shander. Word is that there is an old adventurer however, who might be willing to sell some of his old gear from his adventuring days. Following the direction we got, we find ourselves near Bryn Shander's council hall. A couple of doors down the streets stands a small hovel that fits the description we got of the adventurer's home.

Knocking on the door and waiting for a reply, it takes a while for someone to answer the door. We hear some scuttling and shuffling inside, until eventually an older man opens the door. He introduces himself as [[Ren Eaves]] and asks us our business. When we tell him we're looking for some better gear to aid us in our adventuring, he invites us into his humble home and take a seat near the hearth to warm our limbs from the winter cold outside.

Taking our places near the hearth, the warmth it gives off is welcoming. Next to the hearth we see two bookcases filled to the brim with lots of books, some scrolls and various other items. As Ren sees us eyeing the books, he tells us they're his memoirs of his adventuring days. Among the books we spot some other items as well and Ren notices our interest. Asking us why we're there and what we're looking for, we say that we wanted to buy some magic items and folk around town told us that he's the one we had the best chance with.

Ren takes a long pondering look at all of us and the items in his bookcase. He says that he is willing to part with some of his items from his adventuring days and takes a few books, scroll and items from the bookcase. Laying some items before us, Ren shows us a small case first, telling us that is is a magical foldable boat that is able to hold about 13 people when assembled. Picking up the case it is surprisingly light for ai boat that is able to hold that many people. Ren states that he is willing to part with the boat for about 1200 gold pieces. [[Rotom Moonbane|Rotom]] starts to haggle a bit to try and lower the price, mentioning that we might want to buy more. Ren says that the might be willing to do so and starts showing some other items.

Next Ren shows us a couple of potions. One gives us the strength of a frost giant, the other one grants incredible speed. [[Aust Rime|Rime]] notes that we already have the strengthening potion, but that he is interested in the potion of speed. Putting the potion of speed aside, Ren continues showing his various trophies from his adventuring days.

From the bookcase, Ren grabs a metal rod adorned with a head of a walrus on one end and a walrus' head on the other. Ren holds the rod out in front of him, presses a button and then lets go of the rod. The rod starts floating mid air, unmoving, unaffected by gravity! This seems like a useful tool, though we are not entirely sure in what way yet.

As the final item to show us, Ren grabs a piece of rope from a shelf and lays it in front of us on the floor. Speaking a command word, the ropes starts rising by itself and 


======================

There's rumour of an adventurer in town, that might have some work and gear for us. Lives in a hovel two doors down from the Council Hall. Ren Eaves lives here. Sit down near the hearth, two bookshelves with books of his adventurs. Simple kitchen area next to it.

Book cases are filled to the brim with lots of books, some scrolls and various items. Bags, ceramic jugs painted with fisherman, long piece of metal with head of walrus and wolf's head on either end.

Potion of Speed - 200gp
Foldable boat - 900gp
Immovable Rod - 350gp
Rope of Climbing - 200gp

Rime asks about [[Arveiaturace]], wizard on her back. Ren remembers it as well as a wizard named [[Meltharond]] from [[Luskan]].

We head back to the inn, more sleds outside now. Trovus, a silver dragonborn, speaker of [[Caer-Konig]], is also in the Cold Comforts Inn right now. Sitting together with a woman at a table, having a discussion.

We go sit in a booth for some privacy. Rotom asks one of her kobolds to keep us with drinks the entire night. Rotom drops the stack of research papers [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]] was looking for on the table. I take a look, it's written in a language I don't recognise. The pictures however do portray something that resembles the description of a mythallar.

Brass lockbox from the dragon's hoard is another item we haven't investigated yet. Rotom and Rime want to open the box immediately, but Aedan catches his hand saying that we might want to not open it in a crowded tavern. However, Rotom is with Rime on this one.

She sticks a cilinder into the keyhole. Metal panels open on the top, we see white and black sand in the bottom of the box. It forms ripples and starts to move, when it suddenly jumps up and forms an image of [[Kelvin's Cairn]] in white sand, and below it a root system inside the mountain, where the roots end in a shard.

Rotom sees the glittering sand and moves her hand through it. Initially moving fluidly through the white sand, we her hand getting stopped partly by the black sand, slightly displacing part of the root system.

Santiago walks over to [[Speaker Oarus|Oarus]], who is speaking with a woman. The woman introduces herself as [[Duvessa Shane]].  They talk a bit about the local problems with the followers of [[Auril, The Frostmaiden|Auril]]. Eventually she walks over to our table and we have a chat. Duvessa then asks us if we have been to Easthaven as she's wondering about a prisoner they brought in. Apparently it's a wizard called [[Dzaan]]. Santiago asks if these [[Easthaven]] folk are in this tavern, but Duvessa says they're staying at the Northlook Inn.

We decide to investigate and head over. Santiago finds a seat at a table right next to some folk, flaunting his assless chaps in the face of someone who seems the head of the militia. A woman turns around, and asks if he could do that somewhere else. Santiago ends up in a discussion a bit with the head of militia, who has now introduced herself as Imdra. They're escorting speaker Danneth Weylon and a prisoner.

They let us talk to [[Dzaan]], who's locked in a room upstairs. An older man. 
Found one of the spires of Ythrynn, where a group of young adventurers was sent on a quest to retrieve an item useful to find a titan. Specifically, Duur-Baghaal the Dawn Titan. It's carcass apparently is a path into Ythrynn. Apparently, he used magic on some folk to retrieve the item, which I believe to be the lantern. For that reason, he is sentenced to death.

Suddenly, Rotom starts to cower in a corner as I notice a tremble in his voice, which I recognise as him casting a spell. I get out my crossbow, imbue it with a rite and point it into his face, demanding that he does not do that trick again. The guard in the room seems surprised at my reaction and I explain what he did. Then Dzaan is gagged again so he can't speak anymore. As he is now only able to nod and shake his head, I start asking him simpler questions. Pretty sure that he is looking for the lantern, I take my backpack, get out the lantern and hold it in his face. His eyes grow big, and I ask him if this is what he is looking for. He starts nodding fast, indicating that this is indeed what he is looking for.
