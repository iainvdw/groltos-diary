# Session 25

**15 Deep Winter - Bryn Shander**

We have been travelling for a while now and passed through Bremen to stock up on some food and rations for the journey ahead towards [[Bryn Shander]], [[Termalaine]] and [[Battlehammar Hold]]. 

After a few days we reach the outer gates of Bryn Shander, the largest town in [[Ten Towns]]. It's surrounded by a palisade, with guard towers near the entrances. As we pass through the gates and ride into town to find a tavern and a few shops, [[Rotom Moonbane|Rotom]] notices three kobolds ploughing snow outside the Cold Comforts Inn. Rotom jumps down from her mountain goat and greets them, the kobolds immediately bowing to their queen. Rotom asks what they are doing and where the other two are. The kobolds reply that they're here with [[Speaker Oarus|Oarus]] who's in the tavern with the other two kobolds. Rotom thanks them and hands them a silver piece each. The kobolds gratefully thank Rotom and run inside the tavern, asking us to follow them to Oarus.

We dismount our mountain goats and tie them to a few posts outside the tavern and follow Rotom and her kobold pack inside the tavern. There, we see Oarus sitting at a table together with [[Shalheira]]. I greet them as we walk over to their table and they invite us to join them and talk about our recent adventures. 

Oarus and Shalheira are here for the Council of Speakers, the periodical gathering of all Speakers of Ten Towns where they discuss recent events and future policy. One of the things they're here to discuss is the recent influx of people coming into Bryn Shander from other towns. Seemingly they're people who've fled the towns who are ruled by devout followers of the [[Creed of Auril]], trying to get away from the sacrifices and abysmal conditions under which they had to live. Most of the new folk here came from [[Caer-Dineval]] and [[Targos]], two towns with Speakers who we know are worshipers of [[Auril, The Frostmaiden|Auril]]. The council meeting is due tomorrow, but some speakers who trust each other have come early in town to discuss issues ahead of the council meeting.

We drink and talk for a bit and then leave Oarus and Shalheira to their business as we have our own business to attend to. Looking around town for some suitable places to offload our stolen dragon hoard, we find a couple of shops who take interest in some of our items. An art shop called Wondrous Treasures takes the more artistic items off of our hands, while a jeweller's shop by the name of Ithelor's Finery is keen to buy the various gems, jewelry and ivory carvings. It takes us a couple of hours of finding suitable shops and bartering for prices, but eventually we manage to get about 3350 gold pieces for the various items we sell.

On the way back to the Cold Comforts Inn, I keep my eyes open for a leatherworker and find one called Gold Cask Leatherworks. Inside a couple of halflings are working on various pieces of clothing and armour. Taking out the various tentacles I still carry in my backpack, I ask the woman who's in charge if they can do anything with this. The vampiric mind flayer tentacles have shrivelled up quite a bit and have lost their usefulness. However, the [[Grell]] tentacles are still in a good enough condition to be added to Santiago's Tentacle Rod. She said that she could take a look and asks me to return tomorrow.

Asking around town for some other place to buy some upgraded equipment, there is no real magic item shop around Bryn Shander. Word is that there is an ol





======================

Three kobolds plouging snow in front of Cold Comforts Inn. Rotom gives them each a silver piece. Other two are inside with Oarus.

Oarus and [[Shalheira]] are talking in the tavern. There to present their case to council of speakers.

Lots of people coming in from other towns who are having trouble living there, mainly from [[Caer-Dineval]] and [[Targos]]. Some speakers arrived early to talk to each other one on one, people who they can trust.

Outside we see people shoveling snow. Houses are like Viking architecture, lots of woodwork.

Stables, leatherworkers, smithies, jewelers.

Art shop, Wonderous Treasures.

Jeweler, ivory and scrimshaw, Ithelor's Finery.

We sell of art items and jewelry for 3350gp.

Gold Cask Leatherworks, ask if the grell tentacles can be added to Santiago's Tentacle Rod. She will take a look, come back tomorrow.

There's rumour of an adventurer in town, that might have some work and gear for us. Lives in a hovel two doors down from the Council Hall. Ren Eaves lives here. Sit down near the hearth, two bookshelves with books of his adventurs. Simple kitchen area next to it.

Book cases are filled to the brim with lots of books, some scrolls and various items. Bags, ceramic jugs painted with fisherman, long piece of metal with head of walrus and wolf's head on either end.

Potion of Speed - 200gp
Foldable boat - 900gp
Immovable Rod - 350gp
Rope of Climbing - 200gp

Rime asks about [[Arveiaturace]], wizard on her back. Ren remembers it as well as a wizard named [[Meltharond]] from [[Luskan]].

We head back to the inn, more sleds outside now. Trovus, a silver dragonborn, speaker of [[Caer-Konig]], is also in the Cold Comforts Inn right now. Sitting together with a woman at a table, having a discussion.

We go sit in a booth for some privacy. Rotom asks one of her kobolds to keep us with drinks the entire night. Rotom drops the stack of research papers [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]] was looking for on the table. I take a look, it's written in a language I don't recognise. The pictures however do portray something that resembles the description of a mythallar.

Brass lockbox from the dragon's hoard is another item we haven't investigated yet. Rotom and Rime want to open the box immediately, but Aedan catches his hand saying that we might want to not open it in a crowded tavern. However, Rotom is with Rime on this one.

She sticks a cilinder into the keyhole. Metal panels open on the top, we see white and black sand in the bottom of the box. It forms ripples and starts to move, when it suddenly jumps up and forms an image of [[Kelvin's Cairn]] in white sand, and below it a root system inside the mountain, where the roots end in a shard.

Rotom sees the glittering sand and moves her hand through it. Initially moving fluidly through the white sand, we her hand getting stopped partly by the black sand, slightly displacing part of the root system.

Santiago walks over to [[Speaker Oarus|Oarus]], who is speaking with a woman. The woman introduces herself as [[Duvessa Shane]].  They talk a bit about the local problems with the followers of [[Auril, The Frostmaiden|Auril]]. Eventually she walks over to our table and we have a chat. Duvessa then asks us if we have been to Easthaven as she's wondering about a prisoner they brought in. Apparently it's a wizard called [[Dzaan]]. Santiago asks if these [[Easthaven]] folk are in this tavern, but Duvessa says they're staying at the Northlook Inn.

We decide to investigate and head over. Santiago finds a seat at a table right next to some folk, flaunting his assless chaps in the face of someone who seems the head of the militia. A woman turns around, and asks if he could do that somewhere else. Santiago ends up in a discussion a bit with the head of militia, who has now introduced herself as Imdra. They're escorting speaker Danneth Weylon and a prisoner.

They let us talk to [[Dzaan]], who's locked in a room upstairs. An older man. 
Found one of the spires of Ythrynn, where a group of young adventurers was sent on a quest to retrieve an item useful to find a titan. Specifically, Duur-Baghaal the Dawn Titan. It's carcass apparently is a path into Ythrynn. Apparently, he used magic on some folk to retrieve the item, which I believe to be the lantern. For that reason, he is sentenced to death.

Suddenly, Rotom starts to cower in a corner as I notice a tremble in his voice, which I recognise as him casting a spell. I get out my crossbow, imbue it with a rite and point it into his face, demanding that he does not do that trick again. The guard in the room seems surprised at my reaction and I explain what he did. Then Dzaan is gagged again so he can't speak anymore. As he is now only able to nod and shake his head, I start asking him simpler questions. Pretty sure that he is looking for the lantern, I take my backpack, get out the lantern and hold it in his face. His eyes grow big, and I ask him if this is what he is looking for. He starts nodding fast, indicating that this is indeed what he is looking for.
