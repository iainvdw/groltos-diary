# Session 25

**15 Deep Winter - Bryn Shander**

Three kobolds plouging snow in front of Cold Comforts Inn. Rotom gives them each a silver piece. Other two are inside with Oarus.

Oarus and [[Shalheira]] are talking in the tavern. There to present their case to council of speakers.

Lots of people coming in from other towns who are having trouble living there, mainly from [[Caer-Dineval]] and [[Targos]]. Some speakers arrived early to talk to each other one on one, people who they can trust.

Outside we see people shoveling snow. Houses are like Viking architecture, lots of woodwork.

Stables, leatherworkers, smithies, jewelers.

Art shop, Wonderous Treasures.

Jeweler, ivory and scrimshaw, Ithelor's Finery.

We sell of art items and jewelry for 3350gp.

There's rumour of an adventurer in town, that might have some work and gear for us. Lives in a hovel two doors down from the Council Hall. Ren Eaves lives here. Sit down near the hearth, two bookshelves with books of his adventurs. Simple kitchen area next to it.

Book cases are filled to the brim with lots of books, some scrolls and various items. Bags, ceramic jugs painted with fisherman, long piece of metal with head of walrus and wolf's head on either end.

Rime asks about [[Arveiaturace]], wizard on her back. Ren remembers it as well as a wizard named [[Meltharond]] from [[Luskan]].

We head back to the inn, more sleds outside now. Trovus, a silver dragonborn, speaker of [[Caer-Konig]], is also in the Cold Comforts Inn right now. Sitting together with a woman at a table, having a discussion.

We go sit in a booth for some privacy. Rotom asks one of her kobolds to keep us with drinks the entire night. Rotom drops the stack of research papers [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]] was looking for on the table. I take a look, it's written in a language I don't recognise. The pictures however do portray something that resembles the description of a mythallar.

Brass lockbox from the dragon's hoard is another item we haven't investigated yet. Rotom and Rime want to open the box immediately, but Aedan catches his hand saying that we might want to not open it in a crowded tavern. However, Rotom is with Rime on this one.

She sticks a cilinder into the keyhole. Metal panels open on the top, we see white and black sand in the bottom of the box. It forms ripples and starts to move, when it 

Roots end in a shard.
