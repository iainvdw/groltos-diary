# Session 19

**1 Deep Winter - Battlehammar Hold**

We leave [[Battlehammar Hold]] and set out to the north of [[Lonelywood]], in search of [[Nass Lantomir]].

We find a black cabin on stilts, abandoned and in disrepair. Outhouse outside is empty, apart from some notes. Aedan takes the notes.

Aust walks up the stairs, opens first door. Empty workshop.

Walks across the the walkway, jumps across a gap, walkway gives way under his weight and he falls down.

Aust and I walk up the walkway together and carefully jump across the gap that's now there. Aust opens the door and we walk inside.

Room is wrecked, has burnt table. Also, on the floor is a burnt skeleton holding a weird device. Aust and I try to clear the rooms. 

First room contains wine barrels.

Second room contains two empty bookcases and some blueprints. One of the blueprints moves. Looking underneath, I see a white ferret. I try to lure it with some rations, but it skitters away. Aust casts a spell and starts talking with it.

Behind us, a sudden burst of light. We run back into the other room and see [[Santiago Cruz de los Santos|Santiago]] lying on the floor next to the strange device. His hands and face are charred.

We heal Santiago, said he touched device. Santiago takes up a medallion
