# Ice Troll
![[frost-troll.png]]

A troll variant scouring the icy tundra of [[Icewind Dale]]. These trolls stalk their prey through the snow, only to surprise them by a sudden burst of chilling frost. As with most trolls, the regenerate and heal themselves whenever they're not damaged by fire.

Found one of these eating a seal in [[The Dark Duchess]].
