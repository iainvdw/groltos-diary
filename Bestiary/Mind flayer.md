Mind flayers, also known as illithid, are evil psionic abberations. Luckily I've never encountered one before, but I've heard the stories.

We found a mind flayer skull embedded in a wall in the [[4. Gloom and Gems|mines]] of [[Termalaine]].

We encountered a mind flayer in [[The Halls of the Protectors]], where it was trying to question [[Gorom]]. We defeated it and saved Gorom from his torment.
