# Coldlight Walkers

![[coldlight-walker.jpeg]]

Shambling corpses of victims who have died from extreme cold, their furious spirits forced to haunt the lands, unleashing their bitter anger on any living soul they come across. A bright and cold light emanates from within their frostbitten corpses, chilling anyone caught in the beam of light.

We spotted three of these near the cabin of [[Nass Lantomir]], two of which were the shambling remains of [[Gareth of Daerlun|Gareth]] and [[Ivahn of Daerlun|Ivahn]].
