# Beholder Zombie

![[beholder-zombie.jpeg]]

An undead variant of a regular beholder. Looking like a floating corpse of a beholder, it still retains a fragment of its former power. A pale and pupilless eye sits in the middle of its head, as a few functioning eyestalks protrude from the top. Each eye is rumoured to have its own magical and destructive power.
