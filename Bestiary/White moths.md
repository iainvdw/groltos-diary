# White moths

![[white-moth.png]]
We've spotted several white moths at different locations. Once in [[Speaker Oarus|Oarus']] house when I had a nightmare. Second time was in the mist in the Lonelywood forest, when I had an encounter with [[Omareth Baenre]]. [[Aedan]]'s bees were also missing after a nightmare and he spotted hundreds of moths flying around the empty beehive.
