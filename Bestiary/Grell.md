# Grell
![[grell.jpg]]
In the mine we encountered a strange floating creature. Grell appear like a floating brain with a bird beak, and long tentacles coming down from it with nasty spikes at the end. Grell seem like predatory creatures. They roam around dark areas like mines and caves and stalk upon any unfortunate creatures that might be there.

Grell use their tentacles to sting and poison their victims and then grab them when they fall unconscious. They can fly quite fast as I cannot outrun them.
