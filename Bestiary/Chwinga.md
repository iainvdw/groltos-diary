# Chwinga
![[chwinga.png]]

Chwinga are tiny elemental creatures, about 6 inches high. They have black bodies, with thin arms and legs and seem to wear a white mask.

Being somewhat shy creatures, they are also of a very curious nature, seeming to inspect the aspects of humanoids and their societies.

Such creatures are seemingly attracted to places of tranquility and beauty, and having one appear somewhere would be considered an honour.
