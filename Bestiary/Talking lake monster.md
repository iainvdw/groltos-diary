# Talking lake monster
![[lake-monster.png]]
First encounter: Maer Dualdon. 
Spoke to me, said "Thank you", when I dropped trout into the water to distract it.

We met the lake monster a few days later when we were at [[Amala Bhilar]]'s wellness establishment. She said the monster had been scaring away guests.

Investigating near the docks, the beast appeared and spoke to us. Told us it gained its conscience and means to talk from [[Ravisin]], a druid woman in the nearby forest.
