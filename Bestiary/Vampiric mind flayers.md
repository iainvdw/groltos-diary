# Vampiric mind flayers

![[vampiric-mind-flayer.jpg]]

Twisted and deformed variant of a [[Mind flayer]]. Seemingly having been infected with a vampiric affliction, these creatures hunger for brain matter, spinal and cranial fluids. Their tentacles are longer and twisted, sharp teeth protruding from it to grasp and pull in their prey, while its mouth has a jaw strong enough to crack open a skull to allow it to access inside of the cranium of its victim. Literally sucking the brain, and thus the life, of its unfortunate victims, it can almost instantly kill when it manages to grapple a victim and open up their skull.
